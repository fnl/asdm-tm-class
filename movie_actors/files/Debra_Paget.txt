'''Debra Paget''' (born August 19, 1933) is an American actress and entertainer. She is perhaps best known for her performances in [[Cecil B. DeMille|Cecil B. DeMille's]] epic movie, ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956), as well as ''[[Love Me Tender (1956 film)|Love Me Tender]]'' (1956), the film debut of [[Elvis Presley]].

==Early life==
Paget was born in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]], as '''Debralee Griffin''', one of five children born to Margaret Allen (née Gibson),<ref name="Quotes From The News: Hollywood">{{cite news|title=Quotes From The News: Hollywood|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1665&dat=19580114&id=FUMaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=PyMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7025,596525|accessdate=October 3, 2014|work=[[Times-News (Hendersonville, North Carolina)|The Times-News]]|date=January 14, 1958}}</ref> a former actress, and Frank Henry Griffin, a painter.<ref name="Lovely Debra Paget Ambitious, Talented">{{cite news|last1=Hopper|first1=Hedda|title=Lovely Debra Paget Ambitious, Talented|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19510311&id=zPVOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RAAEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4030,5155427|accessdate=October 3, 2014|work=[[Toledo Blade]]|date=March 10, 1951}}</ref> The family moved from Denver to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], in the 1930s to be close to the developing film industry. Margaret was determined that Debra and her siblings would also make their careers in show business. Three of Paget's siblings, Marcia ([[Teala Loring]]), Leslie ([[Lisa Gaye]]), and Frank (Ruell Shayne), all entered show business.<ref name="ShoFamly">{{Wayback |date=20091026100848 |url=http://geocities.com/showbizfamily/cast.html |title="When You Wish Upon a Star, or It's a Star-Spangled Life: Family Cast"}}</ref>

Paget had her first professional job at age 8,<ref name="ShoFamly" /> and acquired some stage experience at 13 when she acted in a 1946 production of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]''.

==Career==
[[File:Debra Paget in Cry of the City trailer.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Paget in the trailer for ''[[Cry of the City]]'' (1948)]]
Paget's first notable film role was as Teena Riconti, girlfriend of the character played by [[Richard Conte]], in ''[[Cry of the City]]'', a 1948 [[film noir]] directed by [[Robert Siodmak]]. Fresh out of high school in 1949, she acted in three other films before being signed by [[20th Century-Fox]]. Her first vehicle for Fox was the successful ''[[Broken Arrow (1950 film)|Broken Arrow]]'' with [[James Stewart]]. Paget played an Native American maiden, Sonseeahray ("morningstar"), who gives up her life to save Stewart's character.

From 1950 to 1956, she took part in six original radio plays for ''[[Family Theater]]''. During those same years, she read parts in four episodes of ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]'', sharing the microphone with such actors as [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Tyrone Power]], [[Cesar Romero]], [[Ronald Colman]], and [[Robert Stack]]. The latter set included dramatizations of two of her feature films.

In 1953, wearing a blonde wig, she auditioned along with, among others, [[Anita Ekberg]] and [[Irish McCalla]], for the starring role in ''[[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle]]'', which went to McCalla.

In 1955, she broke the exclusivity clause of her contract. She played another Native American girl, Princess Appearing Day, in ''[[White Feather (1955 film)|White Feather]]'' (1955) along with [[Robert Wagner]] and [[Jeffrey Hunter]] and later at [[MGM]] replaced [[Anne Bancroft]] in ''The Last Hunt'' (1956).

The Hollywood [[studio system]] dominated American feature film production in the first half of the 20th century. Under it, an actor would sign an exclusive contract to make films for a major studio, such as Fox. The system worked well at first for Paget as her early Fox films did well, so the studio bolstered her film career. During the year after ''Princess of the Nile'' was released, the fan mail Paget received at [[20th Century-Fox]] was topped only by that for [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Betty Grable]].<ref name="Glamour Girls of the Silver Screen">{{cite web|title=The Private Life and Times of Debra Paget|url=http://www.glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen.com/show/214/Debra+Paget/register.php|website=Glamour Girls of the Silver Screen|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Debra Paget and John Derek in The Ten Commandments film trailer.jpg|right|thumb|200px|With [[John Derek]] in the trailer for ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956)]]
During this time, Fox lent her to [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] for the part of Lilia, the water girl, in [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s biblical epic ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956), her most successful film. She had to wear brown contact lenses to hide her blue eyes; she said that, "If it hadn't been for the lenses I wouldn't have got the part."<ref name="Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes">{{cite news |last=Belser |first=Emily |title=Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&dat=19550601&id=BtUzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EesFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3432,38731 |accessdate=October 3, 2014 |newspaper=[[The Miami News]] |date=June 1, 1955}}</ref> However, she also said that the lenses were "awful to work in because the [[Kleig light]]s heat them up."<ref name="Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes" /> 

''[[The River's Edge]]'' (1957) was the last film she made for Fox. After that, her career began to decline. She was typically cast in exotic roles such as South Sea Island maidens or middle-east harem girls. In 1959, she traveled to Germany to join the cast of [[Fritz Lang]]'s two-film adventure saga (called in America ''Journey to the Lost City'') in a role that recalled her role as Shalimar/Taura of ''Princess of the Nile''. Like the Egyptian epic, ''Lost City'' is remembered chiefly for her energetic dance scenes.

In 1959, Paget appeared as Lela Russell in the episode "The Unwilling" of the [[NBC]] [[Western (genre)|western]] [[television series]], ''[[Riverboat (TV series)|Riverboat]]'', starring [[Darren McGavin]]. In the story line, Dan Simpson, played by [[Eddie Albert]], attempts to open a [[general store]] despite a raid from pirates who stole $20,000 in merchandise. [[Russell Johnson]] appears in this episode as Darius.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0687117/|title="The Unwilling", ''Riverboat'', October 11, 1959|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=February 20, 2013}}</ref>

In 1960, she appeared as Laura Ashley in the episode "Incident of the Garden of Eden" on [[CBS]]'s western series, ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]''. That same year she had played an author, Agnes St. John, the only surviving witness to a brutal stagecoach robbery in another CBS western, ''[[Johnny Ringo (TV series)|Johnny Ringo]]'', starring [[Don Durant]] in the title role. In 1962, she returned to ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' to play the part of Azuela in the episode "Hostage Child" along with James Coburn.

Paget appeared in a pair of films shot in Italy. Her final feature film was ''[[The Haunted Palace]]'', a 1963 horror movie directed by [[Roger Corman]] for [[American International Pictures]]. She did television work throughout her career. Her last performance in this medium came in a December 1965 episode of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Burke's Law]]'', starring [[Gene Barry]]. She retired from entertainment in 1965, after marrying a wealthy oil executive, by whom she had one son, her only child.<ref name="Glamour Girls of the Silver Screen" />

Paget became a [[born-again Christian]]. She hosted her own show, ''An Interlude with Debra Paget'' on the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] (TBN), a Christian network, in the early 1990s, and also was involved in ''Praise the Lord''. She occasionally appears on TBN as a guest.<ref name="ShoFamly" />

In 1987, the Motion Picture & Television Fund presented Paget with its Golden Boot Award, which is awarded to those actors, writers, directors and stunt crew who "have contributed so much to the development and preservation of the western tradition in film and television."

==Personal life==

During production of ''Love Me Tender'' (1956), Elvis Presley became smitten with Paget, who in 1997 claimed the singer even proposed marriage. At the time, however, the media reported that she was romantically linked with [[Howard Hughes]] and nothing came of this.<ref>{{cite book |last= Victor|first= Adam|date= 2008|title= The Elvis Encyclopedia|publisher= Overlook Duckworth|isbn= 9781585675982}}</ref>

In 1958, Paget was married for four months to actor and singer David Street; the marriage was annulled. In 1960, she married [[Budd Boetticher]], a prominent director. They separated after just 22 days, and their divorce became official in 1961.

Paget left the entertainment industry in 1964 after marrying Louis C. Kung, a Chinese-American oil industry executive and nephew of [[Soong May-ling|Madame Chiang Kai-Shek]]. This third marriage produced a son, Gregory, but ended in divorce in 1980.
