===Success and hiatus===
She starred in four films in 2000: ''[[Reindeer Games]]'', ''[[The Yards]]'', ''[[The Legend of Bagger Vance]]'' and ''[[Men of Honor]]'', and was briefly considered a new "[[It girl]]". Theron has said of this period in her career that, "I kept finding myself in a place where directors would back me but studios didn't. [I began] a love affair with directors, the ones I really, truly admired. I found myself making really bad movies, too. ''Reindeer Games'' was not a good movie, but I did it because I loved [[John Frankenheimer]]."<ref>Johnathan Van Meter (October 2004).

Following a three-year hiatus from the big screen, Theron returned to the spotlight in 2011 with ''[[Young Adult (film)|Young Adult]]''.

In 2011, she described her process for becoming the characters in her film:

The Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project (CTAOP) was created in 2007 by Theron, Academy Award winning actor and UN Messenger of Peace, in an effort to support African youth in the fight against HIV/AIDS. CTAOP's mission is to help keep African youth safe from HIV/AIDS. The project is committed to supporting community-engaged organizations that address the key drivers of the disease. Although the geographic scope of CTAOP is Sub-Saharan Africa, the primary concentration has mostly been Charlize's home country of South Africa. CTAOP's approach is based on the belief that community-based organizations on the ground understand the social and structural relationships of their communities better than anyone. By supporting these organizations through grant giving, networking, and spotlighting their work, CTAOP enables communities to mobilize and empower themselves to prevent HIV.<ref name="CTAOP">{{cite web|url=http://www.charlizeafricaoutreach.org|title=Message from Charlize}}</ref>

In December 2009, CTAOP and [[TOMS Shoes]] partnered to create a limited edition unisex shoe.

Theron commented on the subject matter, saying: "I don't want to get married because right now the institution of marriage feels very one-sided, and I want to live in a country where we all have equal rights.
