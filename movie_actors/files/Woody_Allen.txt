'''Heywood "Woody" Allen'''<!--We have a precedent of honoring the legal name first and foremost, cf. [[John Wayne]]. --> (born '''Allan Stewart Konigsberg''',<ref name="birth name"/> December 1, 1935) is an American actor, writer, director, comedian and playwright, whose career spans more than 50 years.

He worked as a comedy writer in the 1950s, writing jokes and scripts for television and publishing several books of short humor pieces. In the early 1960s, Allen began performing as a stand-up comedian, emphasizing monologues rather than traditional jokes. As a comedian, he developed the persona of an insecure, intellectual, fretful [[wikt:nebbish|nebbish]], which he maintains is quite different from his real-life personality.<ref>Gross, Terry (2009–12).

By the mid-1960s Allen was writing and directing films, first specializing in [[slapstick]] comedies before moving into dramatic material influenced by [[European art cinema]] during the 1970s, and alternating between comedies and dramas to the present. He is often identified as part of the [[New Hollywood]] wave of filmmakers of the mid-1960s to late '70s.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/jan/13/woody-allen-michael-newton |title=Woody Allen: cinema's great experimentalist |author=Newton, Michael |date=January 13, 2012 |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group|Guardian News and Media]] |accessdate=April 9, 2012 |quote=In the 1970s, Allen looked irreverent, hip, a part of the New Hollywood generation.

Allen has been nominated 24 times and won four [[Academy Awards]]: three for [[Best Original Screenplay]] and one for Best Director (''Annie Hall'').

To raise money he wrote jokes (or "gags") for agent David O. Alber, who sold them to newspaper columnists.

==Career==

===Comedy writer===
Allen began writing short jokes when he was fifteen,<ref name=Kelley/> and the following year began sending them to various Broadway writers to see if they'd be interested in buying any. He also began going by the name "Woody Allen."<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|539}} One of those writers was [[Abe Burrows]], coauthor of ''[[Guys and Dolls]]'', who wrote, "Wow! His stuff was dazzling." Burrows then wrote Allen letters of introduction to [[Sid Caesar]], [[Phil Silvers]], and [[Peter Lind Hayes]], who immediately sent Allen a check for just the jokes Burrows included as samples.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|541}}

As a result of the jokes Allen mailed to various writers, he was invited, then age nineteen, to join the NBC Writer's Development Program in 1955, followed by a job on ''The NBC Comedy Hour'' in Los Angeles. He was later hired as a full-time writer for humorist [[Herb Shriner]], initially earning $25 a week.<ref name="timemag" /> He began writing scripts for ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[Tonight Starring Steve Allen|The Tonight Show]]'', specials for Sid Caesar post-''[[Caesar's Hour]]'' (1954–1957), and other television shows.<ref name="Lax Bio"/><ref name="imdbprofile">{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000095/+IMDb+profile |title=IMDb: Woody Allen |accessdate=January 17, 2008}}</ref>{{sup|p.111}} By the time he was working for Caesar, he was earning $1,500 a week; with Caesar, he worked alongside [[Danny Simon]], whom Allen credits for helping form his writing style.<ref name="timemag" /><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/27/AR2005072702568_pf.html |title=TV Comedy Writer Danny Simon Dies |work=[[The Washington Post]] |first=Adam |last=Bernstein |accessdate=January 17, 2008}}</ref> In 1962 alone he estimated that he wrote twenty thousand jokes for various comics.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|533}}

Allen also wrote for the popular ''[[Candid Camera]]'' television show, and appeared in some episodes.<ref>{{cite web|date=February 15, 2009 |url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYpROqeKRMY| title=Woody Allen Candid Camera Must See| publisher=YouTube| accessdate=November 5, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=February 17, 1987| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/17/arts/tv-reviews-candid-camera-marks-40-years-with-a-special.html?src=pm| title=TV Reviews; 'Candid Camera' Marks 40 Years With a Special| publisher=The New York Times| accessdate=November 5, 2011| first=John J.| last=O'Connor}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000095/| title=Woody Allen = IMDb| accessdate=November 5, 2011}}</ref> Along with that show, he wrote jokes for the [[Buddy Hackett]] sitcom ''Stanley'' and ''[[Pat Boone|The Pat Boone Show]]''. And in 1958 he cowrote a few Sid Caesar specials with [[Larry Gelbart]].<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|542}} After writing for many of television's leading comedians and comedy shows, Allen was gaining the reputation for being a "genius," says composer [[Mary Rodgers]]. When given an assignment for a show he would leave and come back the next day with "reams of paper,"  adds producer [[Max Liebman]].<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|542}} Similarly, after writing for [[Bob Hope]], Hope called him "half a genius."<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|542}}

His daily writing routine could go as long as fifteen hours, and he could focus and write anywhere necessary. [[Dick Cavett]] was amazed at Allen's capacity to write: "He can go to a typewriter after breakfast and sit there until the sun sets and his head is pounding, interrupting work only for coffee and a brief walk, and then spend the whole evening working."<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|551}} When Allen wrote for other comedians, they would use eight out of ten of his jokes. When he began performing as a stand-up, he was much more selective, typically using only one out of ten jokes. He estimated that to prepare for a 30-minute show, he spent six months of intensive writing.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|551}} He enjoyed writing, however, despite the work: "Nothing makes me happier than to tear open a ream of paper. And I can't wait to fill it! I love to do it."<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|551}}

Allen started writing short stories and cartoon captions for magazines such as ''[[The New Yorker]]''; he was inspired by the tradition of four prominent ''New Yorker'' humorists, [[S. J. Perelman]], [[George S. Kaufman]], [[Robert Benchley]] and [[Max Shulman]], whose material he modernized.<ref>[[Daniele Luttazzi]], preface to the Italian translation of Allen's trilogy ''Complete prose'', ISBN 978-88-452-3307-4 p. 7 quote: {{Wayback |date=20070819085531 |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,346426__422878,00.html}}.

In 2010, Allen released digital spoken word versions of his four books, in which he reads 73 short story selections from his work and for which he was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/20/immortalized-by-not-dying-woody-allen-goes-digital| title=Immortalized by Not Dying Woody Allen Goes Digital|accessdate=July 24, 2012|author=Itzkoff, Dave|date=July 20, 2010|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

===Stand-up comedian===

From 1960 to 1969, Allen performed as a [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] to supplement his comedy writing. His contemporaries during those years included [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Shelley Berman]], the team of [[Mike Nichols]] and [[Elaine May]], and [[Mort Sahl]], his personal favorite. Comedy historian Gerald Nachman notes that Allen, while not the first to do stand-up, would eventually have greater impact than all the others in the 1960s, and would redefine the meaning of stand-up comedy: "He helped turn it into biting, brutally honest satirical commentary on the cultural and psychological tenor of the times."<ref name=Nachman>Nachman, Gerald. ''Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s'', Pantheon, (2003)</ref>{{rp|525}}

After Allen was taken under the wing of his new manager, [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]], who had recently discovered Nichols and May, Rollins suggested that he perform his written jokes as a stand-up. Allen was resistant at first, but after seeing [[Mort Sahl]] on stage, he felt safer to give it a try: "I'd never had the nerve to talk about it before. Then Mort Sahl came along with a whole new style of humor, opening up vistas for people like me."<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|545}} Allen made his professional stage debut at the Blue Angel nightclub in Manhattan in October 1960, where comedian [[Shelley Berman]] introduced him as a young TV writer who would perform his own material.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|545}}

Unfortunately, his early stand-up shows with his different style of humor were not always well received or understood by his audiences. Very unlike other comedians, Allen spoke to his audiences in a low-key conversational style, often appearing to be groping for the right words, although his style was well rehearsed. He acted "normal," dressed casually, and made no attempt to project a stage "personality." And he didn't improvise, "I put very little premium on improvisation," he told [[Studs Terkel]].<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|532}} His jokes were simply created from life experiences, with a comedic twist, and typically presented with a dead serious demeanor which made them funnier: ''I don't think my family liked me. They put a live teddy bear in my crib.''<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|533}}

The subjects of his jokes were rarely topical, political or even socially relevant. Unlike Bruce and Sahl, he did not discuss current events such as civil rights, women's rights, the Cold War, or Vietnam. And although he was described as a "classic nebbish," he did not tell Jewish jokes. Comedy screenwriter [[Larry Gelbart]] compared Allen's style to [[Elaine May]]: "He just styled himself completely after her," he said.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|546}} And like [[Nichols and May]], he often made fun of intellectuals.

TV talk show host [[Dick Cavett]], who was among the minority who quickly appreciated Allen's unique style, recalls seeing the audience at the Blue Angel mostly ignore Allen's monologue: "I recognized immediately that there was no young comedian in the country in the same class with him for sheer brilliance of jokes, and I resented the fact that the audience was too dumb to realize what they were getting."<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|550}} It was his subdued stage presence, while initially unappreciated, that eventually became one of Allen's strongest traits, explains Nachman: "The utter absence of showbiz veneer and shtick was the best shtick any comedian had ever devised. This uneasy onstage naturalness became a trademark."<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|530}} When he was finally noticed by the media, writers like ''New York Times''' [[Arthur Gelb]] would describe Allen's nebbish quality as being [[Charlie Chaplin|"Chaplinesque"]] and "refreshing."

Allen developed a neurotic, nervous, and intellectual persona for his stand-up routine, a successful move that secured regular gigs for him in nightclubs and on television. Allen brought innovation to the comedy [[monologue]] genre and his stand-up comedy would be considered influential.<ref name="LuttazziScanzi2002">{{cite journal| title=''Man on the moon'', interview with comedian [[Daniele Luttazzi]] | first=Andrea |last= Scanzi | publisher= Il Mucchio Selvaggio | year= 2002 | language= Italian}}</ref> Allen first appeared on the Tonight Show in November 1963. He subsequently released three LP albums of live nightclub recordings: the self-titled ''Woody Allen'' (1964), ''Volume 2'' (1965), and ''The Third Woody Allen Album'' (1968) recorded at a fund-raiser for [[Eugene McCarthy]]'s presidential run. The material from these albums was edited and abridged into the 2-LP compilation albums ''Standup Comic'' and ''Nightclub Years 1964–1968'' (also on CD), including his "The Moose" routine, co-written with [[Mickey Rose]].<ref>Michael Barrie [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-barrie/mickey-rose-1935-2013_b_3087301.html "Mickey Rose (1935–2013)"], ''The Huffington Post'', April 15, 2013</ref>

===Playwright===
[[File:Woody Allen - Sam.JPG|thumb|left|Allen with the Broadway cast of ''Play It Again, Sam'' (1969)]]
He became a successful Broadway playwright and wrote ''[[Don't Drink the Water (play)|Don't Drink the Water]]'' in 1966. The play starred [[Lou Jacobi]], [[Kay Medford]], [[Anita Gillette]] and Allen's future movie co-star [[Tony Roberts (actor)|Tony Roberts]]. A [[Don't Drink the Water (1969 film)|film adaptation of the play]], directed by Howard Morris, was released in 1969, starring [[Jackie Gleason]]. Because he was not particularly happy with the 1969 film version of his play, in 1994, Allen directed and starred in a [[Don't Drink the Water (1994 film)|second version]] for television, with [[Michael J. Fox]] and [[Mayim Bialik]].

The next play Allen wrote for Broadway was ''[[Play It Again, Sam (play)|Play It Again, Sam]]'', in which he also starred. The play opened on February 12, 1969, and ran for 453 performances. It featured [[Diane Keaton]] and [[Tony Roberts (actor)|Tony Roberts]]. The play was significant to Keaton's budding career, and she has stated she was in "awe" of Allen even before auditioning for her role, which was the first time she met him. During an interview in 2013, Keaton stated that she "fell in love with him right away," adding, "I wanted to be his girlfriend so I did something about it."<ref name=Keaton>[http://www.netquake.net/2013/06/actress-diane-keaton-talks-about-woody-allen-her-career-and-personal-life/ "Actress Diane Keaton Talks About Woody Allen, Her Career and Personal Life"], ''Netquake'', June 2, 2013</ref> After co-starring alongside Allen in the subsequent [[Play It Again, Sam (film)|film version of ''Play It Again, Sam'']], she would later co-star in ''Sleeper'', ''Love and Death'', ''Interiors'', ''Manhattan'' and ''Annie Hall''.

For its March 21, 1969, issue, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' featured Allen on its cover.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2neatmagazines.com/life/1969cover.html |title=1969 LIFE Magazine Cover Art |accessdate=January 25, 2010}}</ref> In 1981, his play ''[[The Floating Light Bulb]]'' premiered on Broadway and ran for 65 performances. While receiving mixed reviews, it was notable for giving an autobiographical insight into Allen's childhood, specifically his fascination with magic tricks. He has written several one-act plays, including 'Riverside Drive' and 'Old Saybrook' exploring well-known Allen themes.

On October 20, 2011, Allen's one-act play ''Honeymoon Motel'' opened as part of a larger piece entitled ''[[Relatively Speaking (2011 play)|Relatively Speaking]]'' on Broadway, with two other one-act plays, one by [[Coen Brothers|Ethan Coen]] and one by [[Elaine May]].<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/theater/reviews/relatively-speaking-at-brooks-atkinson-theater-review.html "Each Family, Tortured in Its Own Way"] by [[Charles Isherwood]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 20, 2011</ref>

===Early films===
His first movie was the [[Charles K. Feldman]] production ''[[What's New Pussycat?]]'' in 1965, for which he wrote the screenplay.<ref name="PBSdocumentary">{{cite video |people=Weide, Robert B. (Director) |title=Woody Allen: A Documentary |url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/woody-allen-a-documentary/about-the-film/1865/ " |medium=Television |publisher=[[PBS]], November 21, 2011 |accessdate=July 20, 2012}}</ref> He was disappointed with the final product, which inspired him to direct every film that he would later write.<ref name="PBSdocumentary"/> Allen's first directorial effort was ''[[What's Up, Tiger Lily?]]'' (1966, co-written with Mickey Rose), in which an existing Japanese spy movie&nbsp;– ''[[Kokusai himitsu keisatsu: Kagi no kagi]]'' (1965), "International Secret Police: Key of Keys"&nbsp;– was redubbed in English by Allen and friends with fresh new, comic dialogue. In 1967, Allen played Jimmy Bond in the 007 spoof ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''.

Allen directed, starred in, and co-wrote (with Mickey Rose) ''[[Take the Money and Run]]'' in 1969, which received positive reviews. He later signed a deal with [[United Artists]] to produce several films. Those films eventually became ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'' (1971, co-written with Rose), ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (film)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex*]]'' (1972), ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' (1973), and ''[[Love and Death]]'' (1975).<ref name="PBSdocumentary"/> ''Sleeper'' was the first of four films where the screenplay was co-written by Allen and [[Marshall Brickman]].

{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|bgcolor = Cornsilk|quote="I don't like meeting heroes. There's nobody I want to meet and nobody I want to work with—I'd rather work with Diane Keaton than anyone—she's absolutely great, a natural"|source=Woody Allen, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview (1976)
<ref name=Kelley>Kelley, Ken. ''Rolling Stone'', "A Conversation with the Real Woody Allen", July 1, 1976 pp. 34-40</ref>}}

In 1972, Allen wrote and starred in the film version of ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]]'', directed by [[Herbert Ross]] and co-starring Diane Keaton. In 1976, he starred in ''[[The Front]]'' (directed by [[Martin Ritt]]), a humorous and poignant account of Hollywood [[blacklist]]ing during the 1950s.

Then came two of Allen's most popular films. ''[[Annie Hall]]'' won four [[Academy Awards]] in 1977, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress in a Leading Role]] for [[Diane Keaton]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Woody Allen. ''[[Annie Hall]]'' set the standard for modern romantic comedy and ignited a fashion trend with the clothes worn by [[Diane Keaton]] in the film. In an interview with journalist [[Katie Couric]], Keaton does not deny that Allen wrote the part for her and about her.<ref name=Couric>{{YouTube|blGicJHQZdo|"Annie Hall Interview with Diane Keaton by Katie Couric"}}, video interview, 2 min.</ref> She also explains that Allen wrote the part based on aspects of her personality at the time:

{{quote|Of course I recognized myself in the roles [Woody Allen] wrote. I mean, in ''Annie Hall'' (1977) particularly. I was this sort of novice who had lots of feelings but didn't know how to express herself, and I see that in Annie. I think Woody used a kind of essential quality that he found in me at that time, and I'm glad he did because it worked really well in the movie.<ref name=IMDB>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000473/bio "Personal quotes by Diane Keaton], IMDB</ref>}}

The film is ranked at No. 35 on the ''[[American Film Institute]]''{{'s}} "100 Best Movies" and at No. 4 on the AFI list of "100 Best Comedies."

''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]'' (1979), is a black-and-white film often viewed as an homage to New York City. As in many Allen films, the main protagonists are upper-middle class writers and academics. The love-hate opinion of cerebral persons found in ''Manhattan'' is characteristic of many of Allen's movies, including ''[[Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'' and ''[[Annie Hall]].'' ''Manhattan'' focuses on the complicated relationship between middle-aged Isaac Davis (Allen) with 17-year-old Tracy ([[Mariel Hemingway]]), and co-stars Diane Keaton.

Keaton, who made eight movies with Allen during her career, tries to explain why his films are unique:
{{quote|He just has a mind like nobody else. He's bold. He's got a lot of strength, a lot of courage in terms of his work. And that is what it takes to do something really unique. Along with a genius imagination.<ref name=Couric/>}}

Between ''[[Annie Hall]]'' and ''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]'', Allen wrote and directed the dark drama ''[[Interiors]]'' (1978), in the style of the late [[Swedish people|Swedish]] director [[Ingmar Bergman]], one of Allen's chief influences. ''[[Interiors]]'' represented a departure from Allen's "early, funny" comedies (a line from 1980's ''[[Stardust Memories]]'').

===1980s===

Allen's 1980s films, even the comedies, have somber and philosophical undertones, with their influences being the works of European directors, specifically [[Ingmar Bergman]] and [[Federico Fellini]]. ''[[Stardust Memories]]'' was based on ''[[8½]]'', which it parodies, and ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]''. ''[[A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy]]'' was adapted from ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]''. In ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'', part of the film's structure and background is borrowed from ''[[Fanny and Alexander]]''. ''[[Amarcord]]'' inspired ''[[Radio Days]]''. ''[[September (1987 film)|September]]'' resembles ''[[Autumn Sonata]]''. Allen uses many elements from ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]''. In ''[[Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'', Allen references a scene from ''Wild Strawberries''.

{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|bgcolor = Cornsilk|quote="Mia's a good actress who can play many different roles. She has a very good range, and can play serious to comic roles.

''Woody Allen on Woody Allen'', Grove Press (1993) p. 133</ref>}}
''A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy'' was the first of 13 movies Allen made starring [[Mia Farrow]], who stepped into Diane Keaton's role when Keaton was shooting ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]''.

''[[Stardust Memories]]'' features Sandy Bates, a successful filmmaker played by Allen, who expresses resentment and scorn for his fans. Overcome by the recent death of a friend from illness, the character states, "I don't want to make funny movies any more" and a running gag has various people (including visiting space aliens) telling Bates that they appreciate his films, "especially the early, funny ones."<ref name="triviana">{{cite web |url=http://triviana.com/film/sfilm/stmem.htm |title=Stardust Memories review |accessdate=January 17, 2008}}</ref> Allen believes this to be one of his best films.<ref>{{cite news |author= Kamp, David |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/18/books/review/Kamp-t.html |title= Woody Talks |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 18, 2007 |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}</ref>

Allen combined tragic and comic elements in such films as ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'' and ''[[Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'', in which he tells two stories that connect at the end. He produced a vividly idiosyncratic tragi-comical parody of documentary, ''[[Zelig]]''. He also made three films about show business: ''[[Broadway Danny Rose]]'', in which he plays a New York show business agent, ''[[The Purple Rose of Cairo]]'', a movie that shows the importance of the cinema during the Depression through the character of the naive Cecilia, and ''[[Radio Days]]'', a film about his childhood in Brooklyn and the importance of the radio. The film costarred Farrow in a part Allen wrote specifically for her.<ref name=Allen1/>

''The Purple Rose of Cairo'' was named by ''Time'' as one of the 100 best films of all time and Allen described it as one of his three best films, along with ''[[Stardust Memories]]'' and ''[[Match Point]].''<ref name=premiere-interview>{{cite web

|accessdate=December 1, 2010}}</ref> (Allen defines them as "best" not in terms of quality but because they came closest to his vision.) In 1989, Allen teamed with directors [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and [[Martin Scorsese]] to make ''[[New York Stories]]'', an [[anthology film]] about New Yorkers. Allen's short, ''[[New York Stories|Oedipus Wrecks]]'', is about a neurotic lawyer and his critical mother. His short pleased critics, but ''New York Stories'' bombed at the box office.

===1990s===
His 1992 film ''[[Shadows and Fog]]'' is a black-and-white homage to the [[German Expressionism|German expressionists]] and features the music of [[Kurt Weill]]. Allen then made his critically acclaimed drama ''[[Husbands and Wives]]'' (1992), which received two Oscar nominations: Best Supporting Actress for [[Judy Davis]] and Best Original Screenplay for Allen. His film ''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' (1993) combined suspense with dark comedy and marked the return of [[Diane Keaton]], [[Alan Alda]] and [[Anjelica Huston]].

He returned to lighter movies like ''[[Bullets over Broadway]]'' (1994), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Director, followed by a musical, ''[[Everyone Says I Love You]]'' (1996). The singing and dancing scenes in ''Everyone Says I Love You'' are similar to musicals starring [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]]. The comedy ''[[Mighty Aphrodite]]'' (1995), in which Greek drama plays a large role, won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Academy Award]] for [[Mira Sorvino]]. Allen's 1999 jazz-based comedy-drama ''[[Sweet and Lowdown]]'' was nominated for two Academy Awards for [[Sean Penn]] (Best Actor) and [[Samantha Morton]] (Best Supporting Actress). In contrast to these lighter movies, Allen veered into darker satire towards the end of the decade with ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]'' (1997) and ''[[Celebrity (film)|Celebrity]]'' (1998).

During this decade Allen also starred in the TV movie ''[[The Sunshine Boys (TV movie)|The Sunshine Boys]]'' (1995), based on the [[Neil Simon]] [[The Sunshine Boys|play of the same name]].

Allen made one sitcom "appearance" to date (2009) via telephone on the show ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]'' in a 1997 episode, "My Dinner with Woody" which paid tribute to several of his films. Allen provided the lead voice in the 1998 animated film ''[[Antz]]'', which featured many actors he had worked with and Allen's character was similar to his earlier neurotic roles.

===2000s===
''[[Small Time Crooks]]'' (2000) is similar to the 1942 film ''Larceny, Inc.'' (from a play by S.J. Perelman).<ref name=TCM>[[Robert Osborne]] of [[Turner Classic Movies]] on June 15, 2006</ref> Allen never commented on whether this was deliberate or if his film was in any way inspired by it.  ''Small Time Crooks'' was Allen's first film with the [[DreamWorks]] studio and represented a change in direction: Allen began giving more interviews and made an attempt to return to his slapstick roots. The film was a relative financial success, grossing over $17 million domestically but Allen's next four films foundered at the box office, including Allen's most costly film, ''[[The Curse of the Jade Scorpion]]'' (with a budget of $26 million). ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'', ''[[Anything Else]]'', and ''[[Melinda and Melinda]]'' were given "rotten" ratings from film-review website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and each earned less than $4 million domestically.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/p/woody_allen |title=Woody Allen – Rotten Tomatoes Celebrity Profile |accessdate=January 17, 2008}}</ref> Some critics claimed that Allen's films since 1999's ''Sweet and Lowdown'' were subpar and expressed concern that Allen's best years were now behind him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qwipster.net/melindamelinda.htm |title=Melinda and Melinda review (2004) Woody Allen – Qwipster's Movie Reviews |accessdate=January 17, 2008}}</ref> Others have been less harsh; reviewing the little-liked ''Melinda and Melinda'', [[Roger Ebert]] wrote, "I cannot escape the suspicion that if Woody had never made a previous film, if each new one was Woody's Sundance debut, it would get a better reception.

''[[Match Point]]'' (2005) was one of Allen's most successful films of the decade, garnering positive reviews.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/match-point|title=Match Point Reviews|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=December 30, 2011}}</ref> Set in London, it starred [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]] and [[Scarlett Johansson]]. It is markedly darker than Allen's first four films with DreamWorks SKG. In ''Match Point'', Allen shifts focus from the intellectual upper class of New York to the moneyed upper class of London. It earned more than $23 million domestically (more than any of his films in nearly 20 years) and over $62 million in international box office sales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?view=Director&id=woodallen.html |title=Box Office Mojo – People Index |accessdate=January 17, 2008}}</ref> ''Match Point'' earned Allen his first Academy Award nomination since 1998, for Best Writing&nbsp;– Original Screenplay with directing and writing nominations at the Golden Globes, his first Globe nominations since 1987. In an interview with ''[[Premiere Magazine]]'', Allen stated this was the best film he has ever made.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Matloff|first=Jason|date=February 2006|title=Woody Allen's European Vacation|journal=[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]|volume=19|issue=5|pages=98–101|quote=I think it turned out to be the best film I've ever made.|url=http://jasonmatloff.com/selected-articles/woody-allens-european-vacation/}}</ref>

Allen returned to London to film ''[[Scoop (2006 film)|Scoop]]'', which also starred Johansson, [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Ian McShane]], [[Kevin McNally]] and Allen himself. The film was released on July 28, 2006, and received mixed reviews. He filmed ''[[Cassandra's Dream]]'' in London. ''Cassandra's Dream'' was released in November 2007, and stars [[Colin Farrell]], [[Ewan McGregor]] and [[Tom Wilkinson (actor)|Tom Wilkinson]].

After finishing his third London film, Allen headed to Spain. He reached an agreement to film ''[[Vicky Cristina Barcelona]]'' in [[Avilés]], Barcelona and [[Oviedo]], where shooting started on July 9, 2007. The movie stars [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Javier Bardem]], [[Rebecca Hall]] and [[Penélope Cruz]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,249259,00.html |title= Woody Allen's Next Star: Penelope Cruz – Celebrity Gossip |publisher=FOX News |accessdate=January 17, 2008 |date=February 1, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117935397 |title=Spain woos Woody | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=January 17, 2008 |first=John |last=Hopewell |date=January 2, 2006}}</ref> Speaking of his experience there, Allen said: "I'm delighted at being able to work with Mediapro and make a film in Spain, a country which has become so special to me." ''Vicky Cristina Barcelona'' was well received, winning [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy]] at the Golden Globe awards. Penélope Cruz received the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role in the film.

Allen has said that he "survives" on the European market. Audiences there tend to be more receptive to his films, particularly in Spain, France and Italy – countries where he has a large audience (joked about in ''Hollywood Ending''). "In the United States things have changed a lot, and it's hard to make good small films now," Allen said in a 2004 interview. "The avaricious studios couldn't care less about good films&nbsp;– if they get a good film they're twice as happy but money-making films are their goal. They only want these $100 million pictures that make $500 million."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,6737,1278451,00.html |title=Why I love London |first=Simon |last=Garfield |date= August 8, 2004 |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=January 17, 2008 }}</ref>

===Future projects===

For many years, Allen wanted to make a film about the origins of jazz in New Orleans. The film, tentatively titled ''American Blues'', would follow the vastly different careers of [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Sidney Bechet]]. Allen stated that the film would cost between $80 and $100&nbsp;million and is therefore unlikely to be made.<ref>Lax, Eric. Conversations with Woody Allen. Alfred A. Knopf. 2007. pp. 315–316 ISBN 1-4000-3149-4.</ref>

On January 13, 2015, it was announced Allen will write and direct [[Untitled Woody Allen Project (TV series)|a half-hour television series]] for [[Amazon Studios]], marking the first time he has developed a television show. It will be available exclusively on [[Amazon Prime Instant Video]], and Amazon Studios has already ordered a full season. Allen said of the series, "I don’t know how I got into this. I have no ideas and I’m not sure where to begin. My guess is that Roy Price will regret this", a reference to Price, the head of Amazon Studios.<ref name="Weinstein0113">{{cite news |last=Weinstein |first=Shelli |title=Woody Allen to Create His First Television Series for Amazon |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=January 13, 2015 |url=http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/woody-allen-to-create-his-first-television-series-for-amazon-1201403742/ |accessdate=January 13, 2015 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6VYUf4Smy |archivedate=January 13, 2015}}</ref><ref name="Steel0113">{{cite news |last=Steel |first=Emily |title=Amazon Signs Woody Allen to Write and Direct TV Series |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 13, 2015 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/business/amazon-signs-woody-allen-to-write-and-direct-tv-series.html |accessdate=January 13, 2015 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6VYUZqN0V |archivedate=January 13, 2015}}</ref><ref name="Massa0113">{{cite news |last=Massa |first=Antonia |title=Amazon Signs Woody Allen to His First TV Show |publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=January 13, 2015 |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2015-01-13/woody-allen-to-create-his-first-tv-show-for-amazon.html |accessdate=January 13, 2015 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6VYVAXpWB |archivedate=January 13, 2015}}</ref> At the 2015 [[Cannes Film Festival]], Allen said, in reference to his upcoming Amazon show, "It was a catastrophic mistake.

==Theatre==
While best known for his films, Allen has enjoyed a successful career in theater, starting as early as 1960, when he wrote sketches for the revue ''[[From A to Z]]''. His first great success was ''[[Don't Drink the Water (play)|Don't Drink the Water]]'', which opened in 1968, and ran for 598 performances for almost two years on Broadway. His success continued with ''[[Play It Again, Sam (play)|Play It Again, Sam]]'', which opened in 1969, starring Allen and [[Diane Keaton]]. The show played for 453 performances and was nominated for three [[Tony Awards]], although none of the nominations were for Allen's writing or acting.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Broadway League |url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=2849 |title=Internet Broadway Database: Play It Again, Sam Production Credits |publisher=Ibdb |date=March 14, 1970 |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}</ref>

In the 1970s, Allen wrote a number of one-act plays, most notably ''[[God (play)|God]]'' and ''[[Death (play)|Death]]'', which were published in his 1975 collection ''[[Without Feathers]]''.

In 1981, Allen's play ''[[The Floating Light Bulb]]'' opened on Broadway. The play was a critical success and a commercial flop. Despite two [[Tony Award]] nominations, a Tony win for the acting of [[Brian Backer]] (who won the 1981 [[Theater World Award]] and a [[Drama Desk Award]] for his work), the play only ran for 62 performances.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Broadway League |url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=4112 |title=Internet Broadway Database: The Floating Light Bulb Production Credits |publisher=Ibdb.com |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}</ref>

After a long hiatus from the stage, Allen returned to the theater in 1995, with the one-act ''Central Park West'', an installment in an evening of theater known as ''Death Defying Acts'' that was also made up of new work by [[David Mamet]] and [[Elaine May]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mamet.eserver.org/review/1995/death.html |title=Death Defying Acts and No One Shall Be Immune – David Mamet Society |publisher=Mamet.eserver.org |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}</ref>

For the next few years, Allen had no direct involvement with the stage, yet notable productions of his work were staged. A production of ''God'' was staged at The Bank of Brazil Cultural Center in [[Rio de Janeiro]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/36475.html |title=Allen's God Shows Up in Rio, Jan.&nbsp;16 |work=Playbill |date=January 15, 1998 |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}</ref> and theatrical adaptations of Allen's films ''Bullets Over Broadway''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/40306.html |title=Playbill News: Woody Allen Adaptation Debuts at Italian Theater Festival, Aug.&nbsp;1 |work=Playbill |date=July 31, 1998 |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}</ref> and ''September''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/47752.html |title=Playbill News: Stage Version of Woody Allen's September to Bow in France, Sept.&nbsp;16 |work=Playbill |date=September 15, 1999 |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}</ref> were produced in Italy and France, respectively, without Allen's involvement. In 1997, rumors of Allen returning to the theater to write a starring role for his wife Soon-Yi Previn turned out to be false.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/36263.html |title=NY Post: Woody Allen Penning Play for Soon-Yi Previn |work=Playbill |date=December 31, 1997 |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}</ref>

In 2003, Allen finally returned to the stage with ''Writer's Block'', an evening of two one-acts&nbsp;– ''Old Saybrook'' and ''Riverside Drive''&nbsp;– that played [[Off-Broadway]]. The production marked the stage-directing debut for Allen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/79561.html |title=Playbill News: Woody Allen's Writer's Block, with Neuwirth and Reiser, Opens Off Broadway May&nbsp;15 |work=Playbill |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}</ref> The production sold out the entire run.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/89553.html |title=Playbill News: Two Weeks Added to Woody Allen's New Play, Second Hand Memory, at Off-Bway's Atlantic |work=Playbill |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}</ref>

Times'' suggested that Allen should be regarded as a competent musical hobbyist with a sincere appreciation for early jazz: "Allen's clarinet won't make anyone forget [[Sidney Bechet]], [[Barney Bigard]] or [[Evan Christopher]]. His piping tone and strings of staccato notes can't approximate melodic or lyrical phrasing.

==Significant works about Allen==
[[File:Insidewoodyallen.png|thumb|A panel from Stuart Hample's ''[[Inside Woody Allen]]'' comic strip]]
Apart from ''[[Wild Man Blues]]'', directed by [[Barbara Kopple]], there are other documentaries featuring Woody Allen, including the 2002 cable-television documentary ''Woody Allen: a Life in Film'', directed by ''Time'' film critic [[Richard Schickel]], which interlaces interviews of Allen with clips of his films, and ''[[Meetin' WA]]'', a short interview of Allen by French director [[Jean-Luc Godard]]. In 2011 the [[PBS]] series [[American Masters]] co-produced a comprehensive documentary about him, ''Woody Allen: a Documentary'' directed by [[Robert B. Weide]].<ref name="PBSdocumentary"/>

[[Eric Lax]] authored the book ''Woody Allen: A Biography''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Woody Allen: a biography |author=Lax, Eric |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |location=New York |year=1991 |isbn= 978-0-394583495 |oclc=22662351}}</ref> From 1976 to 1984, Stuart Hample wrote and drew ''[[Inside Woody Allen]]'', a comic strip based on Allen's film persona.

==Personal life==

===Marriages and romantic relationships===
Allen has had three wives: Harlene Rosen (1954–1959), [[Louise Lasser]] (1966–1970) and Soon-Yi Previn (1997–present). Though he had a 12-year romantic relationship with actress [[Mia Farrow]], the two never married. Allen also had romantic relationships with [[Stacey Nelkin]] and [[Diane Keaton]].

====Harlene Rosen====
At age 19, Allen married 16-year-old Harlene Rosen.<ref name="timemag-3">{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,877848-3,00.html |title=Woody Allen: Rabbit Running |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |page=3 |date=July 3, 1972 |accessdate=August 4, 2009}}</ref> The marriage lasted from 1954 to 1959. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' stated that the years were "nettling" and "unsettling."<ref name="timemag-3"/>

Rosen, whom Allen referred to in his standup act as "the Dread Mrs. Allen", [[lawsuit|sued]] him for [[defamation]] due to comments at a TV appearance shortly after their divorce. Allen tells a different story on his mid-1960s standup album ''Standup Comic''. In his act, Allen said that Rosen sued him because of a joke he made in an interview. Rosen had been [[raped|sexually assaulted]] outside her apartment and according to Allen, the newspapers reported that she "had been violated".  In the interview, Allen said, "Knowing my ex-wife, it probably wasn't a [[moving violation]]." In an interview on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'', Allen brought up the incident again where he repeated his comments and stated that the sum for which he was sued was "$1&nbsp;million."<ref name=CavettTube>{{cite web|title=Dick & Woody discuss particle physics|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=9xq5Nh2UqCc#t=309|accessdate=November 18, 2013}}</ref>

====Louise Lasser====
Allen married [[Louise Lasser]] in 1966. They divorced in 1970, and Allen did not marry again until 1997. Lasser appeared in three Allen films shortly after the divorce&nbsp;– ''Take the Money and Run'', ''Bananas'', and ''Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)''&nbsp; and later briefly appeared in ''Stardust Memories''.

====Diane Keaton====
In 1970, Allen cast [[Diane Keaton]] in his Broadway show, ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]].'' During the run she and Allen became romantically involved and although they broke up after a year, she continued to star in a number of his films, including ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' as a futuristic poet and ''[[Love and Death]]'' as a composite character based on the novels of [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]]. ''[[Annie Hall]]'' was very important in Allen and Keaton's careers. It is said that the role was written for her, as Diane Keaton's given name is Diane Hall. She then starred in ''[[Interiors]]'' as a poet, followed by ''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]''. In 1987, she had a cameo as a nightclub singer in ''[[Radio Days]]'' and was chosen to replace [[Mia Farrow]] in the co-starring role for ''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' after Allen and Farrow began having troubles with their personal and working relationship while making this film. Keaton has not worked with Allen since ''Manhattan Murder Mystery.'' Since the end of their romantic relationship, Keaton and Allen remain close friends.<ref name="cbs">[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/02/18/48hours/main600975.shtml Q&A: Diane Keaton]. CBS News.

Her bit part in ''[[Annie Hall]]'' ended up on the [[cutting room floor]], and their relationship, though never publicly acknowledged by Allen, reportedly began when she was 17, and a student at New York's [[Stuyvesant High School]].<ref>Fox, Julian.

In her memoir ''Out Came The Sun: Overcoming The Legacy of Mental Illness, Addiction and Suicide in my Family'' (2015), Mariel Hemingway alleged that Allen had a crush on her at the time ''Manhattan'' (1979) was in production and shortly afterwards wanted their platonic relationship to turn into something more.

====Mia Farrow====
Around 1980, Allen began a relationship with actress [[Mia Farrow]], who had leading roles in all of his films as a director from 1982 to 1992. Farrow and Allen never married and kept separate homes.<ref name="woody mia">{{cite news | title=Woody and Mia: A New York Story |author=Lax, Eric |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=5 of 12 |date=February 24, 1991

It was a turning point for the better." Of his relationship with Farrow, he said, "I'm sure there are things that I might have done differently. . . Probably in retrospect I should have bowed out of that relationship much earlier than I did." In 2011, Allen said, <blockquote>"What was the scandal? I fell in love with this girl, married her. We have been married for almost 15 years now. There was no scandal, but people refer to it all the time as a scandal and I kind of like that in a way because when I go I would like to say I had one real juicy scandal in my life."<ref name=Kearney>{{cite news |last=Kearney |first=Christine|url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCATRE75L1OV20110622 |title= Just A Minute With: Woody Allen on nostalgia, scandal | publisher = Reuters |date=June 22, 2011 |accessdate=June 22, 2011}}</ref></blockquote>

====Soon-Yi Previn====
[[File:Soon Yi Previn and Woody Allen at the Tribeca Film Festival.jpg|thumb|left|Soon-Yi Previn and Allen at the 2009 [[Tribeca Film Festival]]]]
After ending his relationship with Mia Farrow in 1992, Allen continued his relationship with Soon-Yi Previn. Though Allen never married Mia Farrow<ref name="woody mia"/><ref>Collins, Glenn (December 25, 1997). [http://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/25/nyregion/mixed-reviews-greet-woody-allen-marriage.html "Mixed Reviews Greet Woody Allen Marriage"], ''[[New York Times]]''.

In 1991, when the relationship began, Allen was 56 and Previn around 19. Asked whether their age difference was conducive to "a healthy, equal relationship", Allen said equality is not necessarily a requirement in a relationship and "The heart wants what it wants. There's no logic to those things. You meet someone and you fall in love, and that's that."<ref>Isaacson, Walter; Allen, Woody (August 31, 1992).

===Children===
Mia Farrow and Allen jointly adopted two children, Dylan Farrow (who changed her name to Eliza and later to Malone)<ref>{{cite news|last=Friedman|first=Roger|title=Mia and Woody's Son Becomes a Marriage Counselor|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2003/08/07/mia-and-woody-son-becomes-marriage-counselor/|accessdate=February 2, 2014|newspaper=FoxNews|date=August 7, 2003}}</ref> and Moshe Farrow (known as Moses); they also had one biological child, Satchel Farrow (known as [[Ronan Seamus Farrow]]). Allen did not adopt any of Farrow's other children, including Soon-Yi Farrow Previn (adopted daughter of Farrow and [[André Previn]], now known as Soon-Yi Previn).

Following their separation, Farrow won custody of their children. Allen was denied visitation rights with Malone and could see Ronan only under supervision. Moses, who was then 15, chose not to see Allen<ref name="Custody">{{cite news| title=Allen Loses to Farrow in Bitter Custody Battle| author=Marks, Peter | url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/02/23/reviews/farrow-verdict.html| publisher=The New York Times| accessdate=November 5, 2011}}</ref> but by age 36 he had been estranged from his mother and reestablished his relationship with Allen and his sister. Farrow also went to court to have Allen's two adoptions with her nullified.

===Sexual assault allegations===
In 1992 Mia Farrow was given full custody of the children after the sexual abuse case was examined in court and it was determined that the abuse could not be ruled out. The judge declared, in his 33-page decision, that Woody Allen’s behavior toward Dylan was “grossly inappropriate and that measures must be taken to protect her.”<ref>http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2014/02/woody-allen-sex-abuse-10-facts</ref>

After Allen and Farrow separated from their long-term relationship in 1993, a long public legal battle for the custody of their three children began. Prior to the proceedings, Dylan Farrow's doctor reported concerns that Allen had sexually molested his adopted daughter, who was then seven years old. The police-appointed medical team concluded that Dylan "was not molested", citing contradictory statements by Dylan.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/04/nyregion/doctor-cites-inconsistencies-in-dylan-farrow-s-statements.html|title=Doctor Cites Inconsistencies In Dylan Farrow's Statement|last=Perez-Pena|first=Richard|date=May 4, 1993|work=The New York Times|accessdate=February 4, 2014}}</ref> The judge eventually found that the sex abuse charges were inconclusive.<ref name=Brozan>Brozan, Nadine (May 13, 1994). [http://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/13/style/chronicle-078638.html "Chronicle"], ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref>

After the custody case, the New York Department of Social Services closed a 14-month investigation in the case and concluded that, "No credible evidence was found that the child named in this report has been abused or maltreated...This report has, therefore, been considered unfounded."<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/26/nyregion/agency-drops-abuse-inquiry-in-allen-case.html</ref>

In February 2014, Dylan Farrow repeated the allegations in an open letter published by [[Nicholas Kristof]], a friend of Mia Farrow, in his blog on ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} website, describing how Allen allegedly sexually abused her in the attic in their Connecticut summer home while she was playing with her brother's train set.<ref name="Open Letter">{{cite news | url=http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/an-open-letter-from-dylan-farrow/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=1& | title=An Open Letter From Dylan Farrow | publisher=The New York Times | work="On the Ground" (Nicholas Kristof blog) | date=February 1, 2014 | accessdate=February 3, 2014 | author=Farrow, Dylan}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/02/dylan-farrow-woody-allen-abuse-allegations|title=Dylan Farrow, adopted daughter of Woody Allen, alleges he abused her|date=February 2, 2014|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|author=Catherine Shard}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-26005565|title=Woody Allen accused of sex abuse by adopted daughter|date=February 2, 2014|publisher=BBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=10 Undeniable Facts About the Woody Allen Sexual-Abuse Allegation|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2014/02/woody-allen-sex-abuse-10-facts|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|author=Maureen Orth|date=February 7, 2014}}</ref> Allen repeated his denial of the allegations, calling them "untrue and disgraceful,"<ref name="Allen reply to Dylan">{{cite web | url=http://uk.news.yahoo.com/allen-rejects-39-untrue-disgraceful-39-sex-abuse-232731191.html#75X0c2d | title=Woody Allen rejects 'untrue and disgraceful' sex abuse claims | publisher=AFP | accessdate=February 3, 2014 | author=February 2, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/03/kangaroo-court-twitter-judge-woody-allen-dylan-farrow|title=The kangaroo court of Twitter is no place to judge Woody Allen|date=February 3, 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=[[Suzanne Moore]]}}</ref> followed by an official response published in the ''New York Times''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/opinion/sunday/woody-allen-speaks-out.html?hp&rref=opinion&_r=1|title=Woody Allen Speaks Out|last=Allen|first=Woody|date=February 7, 2014|work=The New York Times|accessdate=February 16, 2014}}</ref> Dylan's older brother, Moses Farrow, defended Allen, telling [[People magazine|''People'' magazine]], "Of course Woody did not molest my sister," saying that their mother had manipulated her children into hating him as "a vengeful way to pay him back for falling in love with Soon-Yi."

===Psychoanalysis===
Allen spent over 37 years undergoing [[psychoanalysis]], and some of his films, such as ''Annie Hall'', jokingly include references to psychoanalysis. ''Moment Magazine'' says, "It drove his self-absorbed work." Allen biographer John Baxter, wrote, "Allen obviously found analysis stimulating, even exciting."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.momentmag.com/archive/dec99/feat1.html |title=Moment Mag|accessdate=January 17, 2008 |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20070311035947/http://www.momentmag.com/archive/dec99/feat1.html |archivedate = March 11, 2007| deadurl = yes}}</ref> Allen says his psychoanalysis ended around the time he began his relationship with Previn, although he is still [[claustrophobic]] and [[agoraphobia|agoraphobic]].<ref name=Biskind/>

Allen has described himself as being a "militant [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] [[atheist]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvF1HspfnN8l|title=YouTube|date=May 19, 2008|accessdate=May 19, 2008}}</ref>

==Theatre works==
In addition to directing, writing, and acting in films, Allen has written and performed in a number of Broadway theater productions.
