'''David Keith Lynch''' (born January 20, 1946) is an American film director, television director, visual artist, musician, actor, and author. Known for his [[surrealist cinema|surrealist]] films, he has developed a unique cinematic style. The surreal and, in many cases, violent elements contained within his films have been known to "disturb, offend or mystify" audiences.<ref name="lynch245">[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 245.</ref>

Born to a middle-class family in [[Missoula, Montana]], Lynch spent his childhood traveling around the United States, before going on to study painting at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Philadelphia]], where he first made the transition to producing short films. He moved to [[Los Angeles]], where he produced his first motion picture, the surrealist horror film ''[[Eraserhead]]'' (1977). After ''Eraserhead'' became a [[cult classic]] on the [[midnight movie]] circuit, Lynch was employed to direct a biographical film about a deformed man, [[Joseph Merrick]], titled ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'' (1980), from which he gained mainstream success. He was then employed by the [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]], and proceeded to make two films: the science-fiction epic ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]'' (1984), which proved to be a critical and commercial failure, and then a [[neo-noir]] crime film, ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986), which was critically acclaimed.

Next, Lynch created his own television series with [[Mark Frost]], the popular murder mystery ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' (1990–1991; 2016): he also created a cinematic prequel, ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me]]'' (1992); a road movie, ''[[Wild at Heart (film)|Wild at Heart]]'' (1990); and a family film, ''[[The Straight Story]]'' (1999); in the same period. Turning further towards surrealist filmmaking, three of his subsequent films operated on "dream logic", non-linear narrative structures: the psychological thriller ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'' (1997), the neo-noir mystery film ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001) and the mystery film ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'' (2006). Meanwhile, Lynch embraced the [[Internet]] as a medium, producing several web-based shows, such as the animated short of ''[[DumbLand]]'' (2002) and the surreal sitcom ''[[Rabbits (film)|Rabbits]]'' (2002).

Lynch has received three [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations<ref>{{cite web|title=Have 3-Time Academy Award-Nominated Filmmaker David Lynch Review Your Screenplay in LA|url=http://www.charitybuzz.com/auctions/DavidLynchFoundation/catalog_items/311513|work=charitybuzz|publisher=Charitybuzz Inc|accessdate=16 August 2012|author=charitybuzz|year=2012}}</ref> for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and a nomination for best screenplay. He has won France's [[César Award for Best Foreign Film]] twice, as well as the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]<ref name="cannes-1990.com" /> and a [[Golden Lion]] award for lifetime achievement at the [[Venice Film Festival]].

==Life and career==

===Early life: 1946–1965===
{{main|Early life of David Lynch}}
{{Quote box|width=246px|align=right|quote=My childhood was elegant homes, tree-lined streets, the milkman, building backyard forts, droning airplanes, blue skies, picket fences, green grass, cherry trees.

Lynch was born in [[Missoula, Montana]] on January 20, 1946.<ref name="ReferenceA">[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 1.</ref> His father, Donald Walton Lynch, was a research scientist working for the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]], and his mother, Edwina "Sunny" Lynch (née Sundholm), was an English language [[tutor]]. Lynch's maternal grandfather's parents had immigrated to the United States from [[Finland]] in the 19th century.<ref>[http://nojesguiden.se/artiklar/david-lynch-%E2%80%9Dden-haer-vaerlden-aer-full-av-hat-och-angest%E2%80%9D David Lynch: "Den Här Världen Är Full Av Hat Och Ångest"] {{sv icon}}</ref> Lynch was raised a [[Presbyterian]].<ref name="Williams"/><ref name="Sadighian"/> The Lynch family often moved around according to where the USDA assigned Donald. It was because of this that when he was two months old, David Lynch moved with his parents to [[Sandpoint, Idaho]], and only two years after that, following the birth of his brother John, the family again moved, this time to [[Spokane, Washington]]. It was here that his sister Martha was born, before they once more moved, this time to [[Durham, North Carolina]], then to [[Boise, Idaho]] and then to [[Alexandria, Virginia]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Lynch found this transitory early life relatively easy to adjust to, noting that he found it fairly easy to meet new friends whenever he started attending a new school.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 2–3.</ref> Commenting on much of his early life, Lynch has remarked that: <blockquote>I found the world completely and totally fantastic as a child. Of course, I had the usual fears, like going to school&nbsp;... For me, back then, school was a crime against young people. It destroyed the seeds of liberty. The teachers didn't encourage knowledge or a positive attitude.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 14.</ref></blockquote> Alongside this schooling, he joined the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]], although he would later note that he only "became one so I could quit, and put it behind me." He rose to the highest rank of [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]]. It was through being an Eagle Scout that he was present with other Boy Scouts outside of the [[White House]] at the [[United States presidential inauguration|inauguration]] of President [[John F. Kennedy]], which took place on Lynch's birthday in 1961.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 05.</ref>

Lynch had become interested in painting and drawing from an early age, becoming intrigued by the idea of pursuing it as a career path when living in Virginia, where his friend's father was a professional painter.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 8–9.</ref> At Francis C. Hammond High School in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], he did poorly academically, having little interest in school work, but was popular with other students, and after leaving decided that he wanted to study painting at college, thereby beginning his studies at [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] in 1964, where he was a roommate of [[Peter Wolf]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Peter'sBio|url=http://www.peterwolf.com/bio/index2.html|work=Peter Wolf|publisher=Peter Wolf|accessdate=16 August 2012|author=Peter Wolf|year=2011}}</ref> Nonetheless, he left after only a year, stating that "I was not inspired AT ALL in that place", and instead deciding that he wanted to travel around [[Europe]] for three years with his friend [[Jack Fisk]], who was similarly unhappy with his studies at [[Cooper Union]]. They had some hopes that in Europe they could train with the [[expressionism|expressionist]] painter [[Oskar Kokoschka]] at his school. Upon reaching [[Salzburg]], however, they found that he was not available and, disillusioned, returned to the United States after spending only 15 days of their planned three years in Europe.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 31–34.</ref>

===Philadelphia and short films: 1966–1970===
[[File:Six Men Getting Sick.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Screenshot from ''[[Six Men Getting Sick (Six Times)]]''. The film was an animation based upon Lynch's paintings.]]
Back in the United States, Lynch returned to Virginia, but since his parents had moved to [[Walnut Creek, California]], he stayed with his friend Tony Keeler for a while. He decided to move to the city of [[Philadelphia]] and enroll at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]], after advice from Jack Fisk, who was already enrolled there. He preferred this college to his previous school in Boston, claiming that "In Philadelphia there were great and serious painters, and everybody was inspiring one another and it was a beautiful time there."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 36–37.</ref> It was here that he began a relationship with a fellow student, Peggy Reavey, and they were married in 1967. The following year, Peggy gave birth to their daughter Jennifer. Later describing this situation, Peggy stated that "[Lynch] definitely was a reluctant father, but a very loving one. Hey, I was pregnant when we got married. We were both reluctant."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 31.</ref> As a family, they moved to the [[Fairmount, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Fairmount]] neighborhood of Philadelphia, where they were able to purchase a large 12-room house for the relatively low price of $3,500 due to the high crime and poverty rates in the area. Later describing living there, Lynch stated that <blockquote>We lived cheap, but the city was full of fear. A kid was shot to death down the street&nbsp;... We were robbed twice, had windows shot out and a car stolen. The house was first broken into only three days after we moved in&nbsp;... The feeling was so close to extreme danger, and the fear was so intense. There was violence and hate and filth. But the biggest influence in my whole life was that city.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 42–43.</ref></blockquote> Meanwhile, to help financially support his family alongside his art studies, he took up a job printing engravings.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 43.</ref>

It was at the Pennsylvania Academy that Lynch made his first [[short film]], which was titled ''[[Six Men Getting Sick (Six Times)]]'' (1967). He had first come up with the idea when he developed a wish to see his paintings move, and he subsequently began discussing the idea of creating an [[animation]] with an artist named Bruce Samuelson. When this project never came about, Lynch decided to work on a film alone, and so purchased the cheapest 16mm camera that he could find in order to do so. Taking one of the abandoned upper rooms of the Academy as a working space, he spent $200 – which at the time he felt to be a lot of money – to produce ''Six Men Getting Sick''.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 37–38.</ref> Describing the work as "57&nbsp;seconds of growth and fire, and three seconds of vomit", Lynch played the film on a loop at the Academy's annual end-of-year exhibit, where it shared joint first prize with a painting by Noel Mahaffey.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 38.</ref><ref name="ReferenceB">[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 15–16.</ref> This led to a commission from one of his fellow students, the wealthy H. Barton Wasserman, who offered him $1000 to create a film installation in his home. Spending $478.28 of that on purchasing the second-hand [[Bolex]] camera "of [his] dreams," Lynch produced a new animated short, but upon getting the film developed, realized that the result was simply a blurred, frameless print. As he would later relate, "So I called up Bart [Wasserman] and said, 'Bart, the film is a disaster. The camera was broken and what I've done hasn't turned out.' And he said, 'Don't worry, David, take the rest of the money and make something else for me. Just give me a print.' End of story."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 39.</ref>
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lynch The Alphabet.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The opening title of ''The Alphabet'', Lynch's second short film, and the first to include live action elements.]] -->

Using this leftover money, Lynch decided to experiment on making a work that was a mix of animation with [[live action]], producing a four-minute short called ''[[The Alphabet (film)|The Alphabet]]'' (1968). The film starred Lynch's wife Peggy as a character known as The Girl, who chants the [[alphabet]] to a series of images of horses before dying at the end by hemorrhaging blood all over her bed sheets. Adding a sound effect, Lynch used a broken [[Uher (brand)|Uher]] tape recorder to record the sound of his baby daughter Jennifer crying, creating a distorted sound that Lynch felt to be particularly effective. Later describing what had inspired him, Lynch stated that "Peggy's niece was having a bad dream one night and was saying the alphabet in her sleep in a tormented way. So that's sort of what started ''The Alphabet'' going. The rest of it was just [[subconscious]]."<ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 39–40</ref>

Learning about the newly founded [[American Film Institute]], which gave grants to film makers who could support their application with a prior work and a script for a new project, Lynch decided to send them a copy of ''The Alphabet'' along with a script that he had written for a new short film, one that would be almost entirely live action, named ''[[The Short Films of David Lynch#The Grandmother|The Grandmother]]''.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 42.</ref> The Institute agreed to help finance the work, initially offering him $5000 out of his requested budget of $7,200, but later granting him the additional $2,200 that he had requested. Starring people he knew from both work and college and filmed in his own house,<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 44–47.</ref> ''The Grandmother'' featured a neglected boy who "grows" a grandmother from a seed to care for him. The film critics Michelle Le Blanc and Colin Odell later remarked that "this film is a true oddity but contains many of the themes and ideas that would filter into his later work, and shows a remarkable grasp of the medium".<ref>[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 18.</ref>

===Los Angeles and ''Eraserhead'': 1971–1979===
[[File:Eraserhead.jpg|thumb|right|Lynch's ''Eraserhead'', featuring Henry Spencer ([[Jack Nance]])]]
In 1971 Lynch moved with his wife and daughter to [[Los Angeles]], where he began studying filmmaking at the [[AFI Conservatory]], a place that he would later describe as being "completely chaotic and disorganized, which was great&nbsp;... you quickly learned that if you were going to get something done, you would have to do it yourself. They wanted to let people do their thing."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 57–58.</ref> He began writing a script for a proposed work titled ''Gardenback'', which had "unfolded from this painting I'd done." In this venture he was supported by a number of figures at the Conservatory, who encouraged him to lengthen the script and add more dialogue, something that he reluctantly agreed to do. Nonetheless, with all the interference on his ''Gardenback'' project, he became fed up with the Conservatory and announced that he was quitting. Many of the teachers at the center asked him to reconsider, believing that he was one of their best students. He finally agreed on the condition that he could create his own project that would not be interfered with. Feeling that ''Gardenback'' was "wrecked", he instead set about on a new film, which he called ''[[Eraserhead]]''.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 58–59.</ref>

Despite the fact that the film was planned to be about forty-two minutes long (it ended up being eighty-nine minutes long), the script for ''Eraserhead'' was only 21 pages long, and some of the teachers at the Conservatory were concerned that the film would not be a success with so little dialogue and action. Nonetheless, they agreed not to interfere as they had done with ''Gardenback'', and Lynch was able to create the film free from interference. Filming, which began in 1972, took place at night in some abandoned stables, allowing the production team, which was largely Lynch and some of his friends, including [[Sissy Spacek]], [[Jack Fisk]], cinematographer [[Frederick Elmes]] and sound designer [[Alan Splet]] to set up a camera room, green room, editing room, sets as well as a food room and a bathroom.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 59–60.</ref> Initially, funding for the project came from the [[American Film Institute|AFI]], who gave Lynch a $10,000 grant, but it was not enough to complete the work, and under pressure from studios after the success of the relatively cheap feature film ''[[Easy Rider]]'', they were unable to provide him with any more. Lynch was then supported by a loan from his father, and by money that he was able to bring in from a paper route that he took up delivering the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 76 and 60.
</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=David Lynch|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303754904577530860419854198.html?google_editors_picks=true|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=2012-07-22|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69M2PL2hp|archivedate=2012-07-22|date=July 21, 2012}}
</ref>  Not long into the production of ''Eraserhead'', Lynch and his wife Peggy amicably separated and divorced, and so he began living full-time on set. In 1977, Lynch would remarry, this time to a woman named Mary Fisk.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 60, 80, 110.</ref>

Filmed in [[black and white]], ''Eraserhead'' tells the story of a quiet young man named Henry ([[Jack Nance]]) living in a [[dystopia]]n industrial wasteland, whose girlfriend gives birth to a deformed baby whom she leaves in his care. The baby constantly cries, causing much concern. When he realizes the baby has actually become ill, Henry tries to help it. This leads to its accidental death, after which he is haunted by what seem to be daemons that represent the baby and Henry finds himself in a "heaven" which he arrives at by entering the center of a planet rock. Lynch has consistently refused to either confirm or deny any interpretation of ''Eraserhead'', or to "confess his own thinking behind the many abstractions in the film."<ref name="ReferenceC">[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 54.</ref> Nonetheless, he admits that it was heavily influenced by the fearful mood of Philadelphia, and referred to the film as "my ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|Philadelphia Story]]''".<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 56.</ref><ref name = "cehwte">[http://www.davidlynch.de/tiplynchtrans.html David Lynch interview 1985] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5msckwCb2|date =January 18, 2010}}</ref>

Due to financial problems the filming of ''Eraserhead'' was haphazard, regularly stopping and starting again. It was in one such break in 1974 that Lynch created a short film titled ''The Amputee'', which revolved around a woman with two amputated legs (played by Jack Nance's wife, [[Catherine Coulson]]) reading aloud a letter and having her stumps washed by a doctor (played by Lynch himself).<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 66.</ref><ref>[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 17.</ref>

''Eraserhead'' was finally finished in 1976, after five years of production. Lynch subsequently tried to get the film entered into the [[Cannes Film Festival]], but while some reviewers liked it, others felt that it was awful, and so it was not selected for screening. Similarly, reviewers from the [[New York Film Festival]] also rejected it, though it was screened at the [[Los Angeles Film Festival]], where [[Ben Barenholtz]], the distributor of the [[Elgin Theater]], heard about it.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 82–83.</ref> He was very supportive of the movie, helping to distribute it around the United States in 1977, and ''Eraserhead'' subsequently became popular on the [[midnight movie]] underground circuit,<ref name="ReferenceC"/> and was later described as one of the most important midnight movies of the seventies along with ''[[El Topo]]'', ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'', ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'', ''[[The Harder They Come]]'' and ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|id=457414|title=Midnight Movies: From the Margin to the Mainstream}}</ref> The acclaimed film maker [[Stanley Kubrick]] said that it was one of his all-time favorite films.<ref name="lynch77">[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 77.</ref>

===''The Elephant Man'' and mainstream success: 1980–1982===
After the cult success of ''Eraserhead'' on the underground circuit, [[Stuart Cornfeld]], an executive producer for [[Mel Brooks]], saw it and later remarked that "I was just 100 percent blown away&nbsp;... I thought it was the greatest thing I'd ever seen. It was such a cleansing experience."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 88.</ref> Contacting Lynch, he agreed to help him with his next planned project, a film titled ''[[Ronnie Rocket]]'' for which Lynch had already written a script. However, Lynch soon realized that ''Ronnie Rocket'', a film that he described as being about "electricity and a three-foot guy with red hair", was not going to be picked up by any financiers, and so he asked Cornfeld to find him a script written by someone else which he could direct. Cornfeld found him four possible scripts. On hearing the title of the first, ''The Elephant Man'', Lynch chose the script<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 90–92.</ref>

''The Elephant Man'' script, written by Chris de Vore and Eric Bergren, was based on a true story, that of [[Joseph Merrick]], a heavily deformed man living in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] London, who was held in a sideshow but was later taken under the care of a London surgeon, [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Frederick Treves]]. Lynch wanted to make some alterations that would alter the story from true events, but in his view make a better plot.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 95.</ref> However, in order to do so he would have to get the permission of [[Mel Brooks]], whose company, BrookFilms, would be responsible for production; subsequently Brooks viewed ''Eraserhead'', and after coming out of the screening theatre, embraced Lynch, declaring that "You're a madman, I love you! You're in."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 92–93.</ref>

The resulting film, ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'', starred [[John Hurt]] as John Merrick (his name was changed from Joseph), as well as [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Frederick Treves. Filming took place in London, and Lynch brought his own distinctively surrealist approach to the film, filming it in color stock black and white. Nonetheless it has been described as "one of the most conventional" of his films.<ref>[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 29–30.</ref> ''The Elephant Man'' was a huge critical and commercial success, and earned eight [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] for Lynch personally.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 104.</ref>

===The De Laurentiis films, ''Dune'' and ''Blue Velvet'': 1983–1986===
Following on from the success of ''The Elephant Man'', the filmmaker [[George Lucas]], himself a fan of ''Eraserhead'', offered Lynch the opportunity to direct the third film in his ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy, ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]''. Lynch however refused, arguing that Lucas should direct the film himself as the movie should reflect his own vision, not Lynch's take on it.<ref name = "cehwte" /><ref name="lynch113">[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 113.</ref> Soon after however, the opportunity to direct another big-budget [[science fiction]] epic arose when [[Dino de Laurentiis]] of the [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]] asked him to create a film adaptation of [[Frank Herbert]]'s [[science fiction novel]] ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' (1965).<ref name="lynch113"/> Lynch agreed, and in doing so was also contractually obliged to produce two other works for the company. He then set about writing a script based upon the original novel, initially with both Chris de Vore and Eric Bergren, and then just by himself when De Laurentiis wasn't happy with their ideas.<ref name="lynch115">[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 115.</ref> Lynch also helped build some of the sets, attempting to create "a certain look" for the film, and he particularly enjoyed building the set for the [[oil]] planet of [[Giedi Prime]], for which he "used steel, bolts, and porcelain to construct" it.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 118.</ref>

''Dune'' is set in the far future, when humans live in an interstellar empire under a [[feudalism|feudal system]]. The main character, [[Paul Atreides]] (played by [[Kyle MacLachlan]]), is the son of a noble who takes control of the [[desert planet]] [[Arrakis]], which grows the rare spice [[melange (fictional drug)|melange]], the most highly prized commodity in the empire. Lynch, however, was unhappy with the work, later remarking that "''Dune'' was a kind of studio film. I didn't have [[final cut privilege|final cut]]. And, little by little, I was subconsciously making compromises" to his own vision.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 120.</ref> Much of his footage was eventually removed from the final theatrical cut, dramatically condensing the plot.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 116–117.</ref> Although De Laurentiis hoped it would be as successful as ''Star Wars'', Lynch's ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]'' (1984) was a critical and commercial dud; it had cost $45 million to make, and grossed a mere $27.4 million domestically. Later on, [[Universal Studios]] released an "extended cut" of the film for syndicated television, containing almost an hour of cutting-room-floor footage and new narration. Such was not representative of Lynch's intentions, but the studio considered it more comprehensible than the original two-hour version. Lynch objected to these changes and had his name struck from the extended cut, which has "[[Alan Smithee]]" credited as the director and "Judas Booth" (a pseudonym which Lynch himself invented, inspired by his own feelings of betrayal) as the screenwriter.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=l5JwyKjpH2QC&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41 |title=The cinema of David Lynch: American dreams, nightmare visions |author1=Erica Sheen |author2=Annette Davison |publisher=Wallflower Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-903364-85-7}}</ref>

Meanwhile, in 1983, he had begun the writing and drawing of a comic strip, ''[[The Angriest Dog in the World]]'', which featured unchanging graphics of a tethered dog that was so angry that it could not move, alongside cryptic philosophical references. It ran from 1983 until 1992 in the ''[[Village Voice]]'', ''[[Creative Loafing]]'' and other tabloid and alternative publications.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 109.</ref> It was around this period that Lynch also became interested in [[photography]] as an art form, and travelled to northern England to take photos of the degrading industrial landscape, something that he was particularly interested in.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 109–111.</ref>

Following on from ''Dune'', Lynch was contractually still obliged to produce two other projects for De Laurentiis: the first of these was a planned sequel, which due to the film's lack of success never went beyond the script stage.<ref name="lynch115"/> The other was a more personal work, based upon a script that Lynch had been working on for some time. Developing from ideas that Lynch had had since 1973, the resulting film, ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'', was set in the fictional town of Lumberton, USA, and revolves around a college student named Jeffrey Beaumont ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]), who finds a severed ear in a field. Subsequently investigating further with the help of friend Sandy ([[Laura Dern]]), he uncovers that it is related to a criminal gang led by psychopath [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]] ([[Dennis Hopper]]), who has kidnapped the husband and child of singer Dorothy Vallens ([[Isabella Rossellini]]) and repeatedly subjects her to [[rape]]. Lynch himself characterizes the story as "a dream of strange desires wrapped inside a mystery story".<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 138.</ref>

For the film, Lynch decided to include pop songs from the 1950s, including "[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]" by [[Roy Orbison]] and "[[Blue Velvet (song)|Blue Velvet]]" by [[Bobby Vinton]], the latter of which was largely inspirational for the film, with Lynch stating that "It was the song that sparked the movie&nbsp;... There was something mysterious about it. It made me think about things. And the first things I thought about were [[lawn]]s – lawns and the neighbourhood."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 134.</ref> Other music for the film was also produced, this time composed by [[Angelo Badalamenti]], who would go on to produce the music for most of Lynch's subsequent cinematic works.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 130–132.</ref> Dino de Laurentiis loved the film, and it achieved support from some of the early specialist screenings, but the preview screenings to a mainstream audience were instead highly negative, with most of the audience hating the film.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 148–149.</ref> Although Lynch had found success previously with ''The Elephant Man'', ''Blue Velvet''{{'}}s controversy with audiences and critics introduced him into the mainstream, and became a huge critical and moderate commercial success. The film earned Lynch his second [[Academy Award for Best Director|Academy Award nomination for Best Director]]. [[Woody Allen]], whose film ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'' was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], said that ''Blue Velvet'' was his favorite film of the year.<ref name="Peary">{{cite book | title = Cult Movies 3 | first = Danny | last = Peary | year = 1988 | publisher = Simon & Schuster Inc. | location = New York | pages = 38–42 | isbn = 0-671-64810-1}}</ref>

[[File:David Lynch at the 1990 Emmy Awards.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Lynch at the 1990 [[Emmy Awards]] ceremony]]
During the late 1980s, Lynch had begun to work in [[television]] as well as cinema, directing a short piece titled ''The Cowboy and the Frenchman'' for French television in 1989.<ref>[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 81.</ref> Around this time, he met the television producer [[Mark Frost]], who had formerly worked on such projects as the television police series ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'', and they decided to start working together on a biopic of singer and actress [[Marilyn Monroe]] based upon Anthony Summers's book, ''The Goddess: The Secret Lives of Marilyn Monroe''. While this project never got off the ground, the duo went on to work on a comedy script named ''One Saliva Bubble'', but that did not see completion either.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 156–157.</ref><ref>[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 85.</ref> While they were talking in a coffee shop, Lynch and Frost had the idea of a corpse washing up on the shore of a lake, and subsequently set about on their third project, initially called ''Northwest Passage'' but would eventually become the television series ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' (1990–1991).<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 157.</ref>
A drama series set in a small [[Washington (state)|Washington]] town where popular high school student [[Laura Palmer]] has been raped and murdered, ''Twin Peaks'' featured [[FBI]] [[Dale Cooper|Special Agent Dale Cooper]] ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]) as the investigator trying to unearth the killer, and discovering not only the [[supernatural]] elements to the murder but also the secrets of many of the local townsfolk; as Lynch himself summed it up, "The project was to mix a police investigation with the ordinary lives of the characters." Lynch later revealed that "[Mark Frost and I] worked together, especially in the initial stages. Later on we started working more apart." They pitched the series to the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Network]], who agreed to finance the [[Television pilot|pilot episode]] and eventually commissioned the first season, comprising seven episodes.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 157–159.</ref>

A second season went into production soon on 22 additional episodes. Lynch himself only directed six episodes of series to devote his time to working on the film ''Wild at Heart'', but carefully chose the directors for other episodes.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 174–175.</ref> Lynch appeared in several episodes of the series as the deaf FBI agent [[Gordon Cole (Twin Peaks)|Gordon Cole]]. The series was a success, with high ratings both in the United States and in many nations abroad, and soon spawned a cult following. Executives at the ABC Network, however, believed that public interest in the show was decreasing. The network insisted that Lynch and Frost reveal who the killer of Laura Palmer was prematurely, which they begrudgingly agreed to do.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 180–181.</ref> Lynch felt that agreeing to do so is one of his biggest professional regrets.<ref>"A Slice of Lynch", a featurette included in the ''Twin Peaks Definitive Gold Box Edition" DVD set, October 2007.</ref> Following the revealing of the murderer and the series' move from Thursday to Saturday night, ''Twin Peaks'' continued for several more episodes, but was cancelled following a ratings drop. Lynch, who disliked the direction that the writers and directors took in the previous episodes, directed the final episode. He ended the season on a [[cliffhanger]], later stating that "that's not the ending. That's the ending that people were stuck with."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 182.</ref>

While ''Twin Peaks'' was in production, the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] asked Lynch and the composer [[Angelo Badalamenti]], who had been responsible for the music in ''Twin Peaks'', to create a theatrical piece which would be performed only twice in 1989 as a part of the [[New Music America Festival]]. The result was ''[[Industrial Symphony No. 1]]: The Dream of the Broken Hearted'', which starred frequent Lynch collaborators such as [[Laura Dern]], [[Nicolas Cage]] and [[Michael J. Anderson]], and contained five songs sung by [[Julee Cruise]]. David Lynch produced a fifty-minute video of the performance in 1990.<ref>[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 55–56.</ref> Meanwhile, Lynch was also involved in the creation of various [[commercials]] for different companies, including perfume companies like [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Calvin Klein]] and [[Giorgio Armani]] and the Japanese coffee company Namoi, which featured a Japanese man searching the town of Twin Peaks for his missing wife.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 211–212.</ref>

{{Quote box|width=246px|align=right|quote=1990 was Lynch's annus mirabilis: ''Wild at Heart'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] at [[Cannes]], and the television series ''Twin Peaks'' was proving a smash hit with audiences across the world. The musical/performance piece ''Industrial Symphony No. 1'', which Lynch had staged with Angelo Badalamenti at the Brooklyn Academy of music, had spawned the album ''Floating into the Night'' and launched singer [[Julee Cruise]]. Five one-man exhibitions between 1989 and 1991 emphasized Lynch's roots in fine art and painting, and a rash of ads (including a teaser trailer for [[Michael Jackson]]'s 'Dangerous' tour) confirmed the demand for the Lynch touch&nbsp;...

}}

While Lynch was working on the first few episodes of ''Twin Peaks'', his friend [[Monty Montgomery (producer)|Monty Montgomery]] "gave me a book that he wanted to direct as a movie. He asked if I would maybe be [[executive producer]] or something, and I said 'That's great, Monty, but what if I read it and fall in love with it and want to do it myself?' And he said, 'In that case, you can do it yourself'." The book was [[Barry Gifford]]'s novel ''Wild at Heart: The Story of Sailor and Lula'', which told the tale of two lovers on a road trip. Lynch felt that it was "just exactly the right thing at the right time. The book and the violence in America merged in my mind and many different things happened."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 193.</ref> With Gifford's support, Lynch adapted the novel into a film called ''[[Wild at Heart (film)|Wild at Heart]]'', a [[crime fiction|crime]] and [[road movie]] starring [[Nicolas Cage]] as Sailor and [[Laura Dern]] as Lula. Describing his plot as a "strange blend" of "a road picture, a love story, a psychological drama and a violent comedy", Lynch altered much from the original novel, changing the ending and incorporating numerous references to the classic film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 193–194, 198.</ref> Despite receiving a muted response from American critics and viewers, it won the prestigious [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1990 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name="cannes-1990.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/164/year/1990.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Wild at Heart |accessdate=August 7, 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>

Following on from the success of ''Wild at Heart'', Lynch decided to return to the world of the now-cancelled ''Twin Peaks'', this time without Mark Frost, to create a film that acted primarily as a prequel but also, in part, as a sequel, with Lynch stating that "I liked the idea of the story going back and forth in time."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 187.</ref> The result, ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me]]'' (1992), primarily revolved around the last few days in the life of Laura Palmer, and was much "darker" in tone than the television series, having much of the humour removed, and dealing with such topics as [[incest]] and [[murder]]. Lynch himself stated that the film was about "the loneliness, shame, guilt, confusion and devastation of the victim of incest." ''Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me'' was financed by the company CIBY-2000, and most of the cast of the series agreed to reprise their roles for the film, although some refused and many were not enthusiastic about the project.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 184–187.</ref> The film was a commercial and critical failure in the United States; however, it was a hit in Japan and some critics, such as [[Mark Kermode]], have hailed it as Lynch's "masterpiece".<ref name="Kermode, Mark">{{cite news | last = Kermode | first = Mark | coauthors = | title = David Lynch | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = February 8, 2007 | url = http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,2011369,00.html | accessdate =October 27, 2009 | location=London}}</ref>

Meanwhile, Lynch worked with Mark Frost on some new television shows. After ''Twin Peaks'', they produced a series of documentaries titled ''[[American Chronicles]]'' (1990) which examined life across the United States, the comedy series ''[[On the Air (TV series)|On the Air]]'' (1992), which was cancelled after only three episodes had aired, and the three-episode [[HBO]] [[mini-series]] ''[[Hotel Room]]'' (1993) about events that happen in one hotel room but on different dates.<ref>[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 82–84.</ref>

===''Lost Highway'', ''The Straight Story'' and ''Mulholland Drive'': 1997–2001===
Following these unsuccessful television ventures, Lynch returned to making feature films. In 1997 he released the non-linear, [[film noir|noiresque]] ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'', which was co-written by Barry Gifford and starred [[Bill Pullman]] and [[Patricia Arquette]]. The film failed commercially and received a mixed response from critics.

Following ''Lost Highway'', Lynch began work directing a film from a script written by [[Mary Sweeney]] and [[John E. Roach]]. The resulting motion picture, ''[[The Straight Story]]'' was based upon a true story: that of Alvin Straight (played in the film by [[Richard Farnsworth]]), an elderly man from [[Laurens, Iowa|Laurens]], [[Iowa]], who goes on a three hundred mile journey to visit his sick brother (played by [[Harry Dean Stanton]]) in [[Mount Zion, Wisconsin]], riding a [[lawnmower]] for the entire journey. Commenting on why he chose this script, Lynch said that "that's what I fell in love with next", and displayed his admiration for Straight, describing him as "like [[James Dean]], except he's old."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 247, 252.</ref> [[Angelo Badalamenti]] again produced the music for the film, although it was "very different from the kind of score he's done for [Lynch] in the past."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 260.</ref> Among the many differences with his earlier films, "The Straight Story" did not contain profanities, sexual content or violence; it was rated G (general viewing) by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], which came as "shocking news" to many in the film industry, who were surprised that it "did not disturb, offend or mystify."<ref name="lynch245"/> As Le Blanc and Odell stated, the plot made it "seem as far removed from Lynch's earlier works as could be imagined, but in fact right from the very opening, this is entirely his film – a surreal road movie".<ref>[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 69.</ref>

The same year, Lynch approached [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] once again with ideas for a television [[drama]]. The network gave Lynch the go-ahead to shoot a two-hour pilot for the series ''Mulholland Drive'', but disputes over content and running time led to the project being shelved indefinitely. However, with seven million dollars from the French [[production company]] [[StudioCanal]], Lynch completed the pilot as a film, ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''. The film, a non-linear narrative surrealist tale of the dark side of [[Hollywood]], stars [[Naomi Watts]], [[Laura Harring]] and [[Justin Theroux]]. The film performed relatively well at the [[box office]] worldwide and was a critical success, earning Lynch a [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Director]] prize at the [[2001 Cannes Film Festival]] (shared with [[Joel Coen]] for ''[[The Man Who Wasn't There (2001 film)|The Man Who Wasn't There]]'') and a Best Director award from the New York Film Critics Association. In addition, Lynch received his third Academy Award nomination for Best Director.<ref name="oscar-db">{{cite web|title=Academy Award Database: Lynch, David|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=13035139382341|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=April 23, 2011}}</ref>

=== Internet work and ''Inland Empire'': 2002–present ===
[[File:David lynch grayscale.jpg|thumb|upright|Lynch in 2007]]
With the rising popularity of the [[Internet]], Lynch decided to utilize it as a new distribution channel, releasing several new series that he had created exclusively on his website, davidlynch.com. In 2002, he created a series of online shorts named ''[[DumbLand]]''. Intentionally crude both in content and execution, the eight-episode series was later released on DVD.<ref>{{cite news|title=It's Just Lynch|url=http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/screen/its_just_lynch-38410479.html|accessdate=16 August 2012|newspaper=Philadelphia Weekly|date=4 January 2006|author=Leo Charney|agency=Review Publishing Limited Partnershi}}</ref> The same year, Lynch released a surreal [[sitcom]] on his website called ''[[Rabbits (film)|Rabbits]]'', about a family of humanoid rabbits. Later, he made his experiments with [[DV|Digital Video]] available in the form of the Japanese-style horror short ''[[Darkened Room]]''. In 2006, Lynch's feature film ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'' was released. At three hours long, it was the longest of Lynch's films. Like ''Mulholland Drive'' and ''Lost Highway'' before it, the film did not follow a traditional narrative structure. It starred Lynch regulars [[Laura Dern]], [[Harry Dean Stanton]] and [[Justin Theroux]], with cameos by [[Naomi Watts]] and Laura Harring (voices of Suzie and Jane Rabbit), and a performance by [[Jeremy Irons]]. Lynch described the piece as "a mystery about a woman in trouble". In an effort to promote the film, Lynch made appearances with a cow and a placard bearing the slogan "Without cheese there would be no ''Inland Empire''".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2007-02-07/entertainment/17233482_1_inland-empire-bird-feeders-squirrels |title=Lynch dives within |author=Neva Chonin |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=February 7, 2007 |accessdate=March 21, 2011}}</ref>

The concert was [[Streaming media|streamed live]] on YouTube from the [[Mayan Theater]] in Los Angeles as the kickoff to the second season of ''[[Unstaged: An Original Series from American Express]]''.

==Cinematic influences and themes==

===Influences===
{{Quote box|width=246px|align=right|quote=I look at the world and I see absurdity all around me. People do strange things constantly, to the point that, for the most part, we manage not to see it. That's why I love coffee shops and public places – I mean, they're all out there.|source=David Lynch<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 199.</ref>}}
Lynch says that his work is more similar in many respects to those of European film makers than American ones, believing that most films that "get down and thrill your soul" were by European directors.<ref name="lynch62">[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 62.</ref> Lynch has commented on his admiration for such film makers as [[Stanley Kubrick]],<ref name="lynch77"/> [[Federico Fellini]],<ref name="lynch62"/> [[Werner Herzog]]<ref name="lynch62"/> and [[Jacques Tati]].<ref name="lynch62"/> He has also stated that [[Billy Wilder]]'s ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950) is one of his favourite films,<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 71.</ref> as is Kubrick's ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'' (1962).<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 21.</ref>

===Motifs===
There are several recurring themes within Lynch's work, leading film critics Le Blanc and Odell to state that "his films are so packed with motifs, recurrent characters, images, compositions and techniques that you could view his entire output as one large jigsaw puzzle of ideas".<ref>[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 08.</ref> One of the key themes that they noted was the usage of dreams and [[dreamlike]] imagery and structure within his works, something they related to the "[[surrealist]] ethos" of relying "on the [[subconscious]] to provide visual drive". This can be seen in [[Joseph Merrick|John Merrick]]'s dream of his mother in ''The Elephant Man'', [[Dale Cooper|Agent Cooper]]'s dreams of the red room in ''Twin Peaks'' and the "dreamlike logic" of the narrative found in ''Eraserhead'', ''Mulholland Drive'' and ''Inland Empire''.<ref>[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 8–9.</ref> Discussing his attitude to dreams, Lynch has stated that "Waking dreams are the ones that are important, the ones that come when I'm quietly sitting in a chair, letting my mind wander. When you sleep, you don't control your dream. I like to dive into a dream world that I've made or discovered; a world I choose&nbsp;... [You can't really get others to experience it, but] right there is the power of cinema."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 15.</ref> His films are known for their use of [[magic realism]].

Another of Lynch's prominent themes include [[industry]], with repeated imagery of "the clunk of machinery, the power of pistons, shadows of oil drills pumping, screaming woodmills and smoke billowing factories", as can be seen with the industrial wasteland in ''Eraserhead'', the factories in ''The Elephant Man'', the sawmill in ''Twin Peaks'' and the lawn mower in ''The Straight Story''.<ref name="autogenerated9">[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 9–11.</ref> Describing his interest in such things, Lynch stated that "It makes me feel good to see giant machinery, you know, working: dealing with molten metal. And I like fire and smoke. And the sounds are so powerful. It's just big stuff. It means that things are being made, and I really like that."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 110.</ref>

Another theme is the dark underbelly of violent criminal activity within a society, such as with Frank's gang in ''Blue Velvet'' and the cocaine smugglers in ''Twin Peaks''. The idea of [[deformity]] is also found in several of Lynch's films, from ''The Elephant Man'' to the deformed baby in ''Eraserhead'', as well as death from head wounds, found in most of Lynch's films. Other imagery commonly used in Lynch's works are flickering electricity or lights, fire and stages upon which a singer performs, often surrounded by drapery.<ref name="autogenerated9"/>

With the exception of ''The Elephant Man'' and ''Dune'', which are set in [[Victorian London]] and a fictitious galaxy respectively, all of Lynch's films have been set in the [[United States]], and he has stated that "I like certain things about America and it gives me ideas. When I go around and I see things, it sparks little stories, or little characters pop out, so it just feels right to me to, you know, make American films."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 18.</ref> A number of his works, including ''Blue Velvet'', ''Twin Peaks'' and ''Lost Highway'' are intentionally reminiscent of the 1950s American culture despite being set in the later decades of the 20th century. Lynch for this era that coincided with his childhood by stating that "It was a fantastic decade in a lot of ways&nbsp;... there was something in the air that is not there any more at all. It was such a great feeling, and not just because I was a kid. It was a really hopeful time, and things were going up instead of going down. You got the feeling you could do anything. The future was bright. Little did we know we were laying the groundwork then for a disastrous future."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 3–5.</ref>

Lynch also tends to feature his leading female actors in "split" roles, so that many of his female characters have multiple, fractured identities. This practice began with his choice to cast [[Sheryl Lee]] as both [[Laura Palmer]] and her cousin [[Maddy Ferguson]] in ''Twin Peaks'' and continued in his later works. In ''Lost Highway'', [[Patricia Arquette]] plays the dual role of Renee Madison/Alice Wakefield, while in ''Mulholland Drive'' [[Naomi Watts]] plays Diane Selwyn/Betty Elms and Laura Harring plays Camilla Rhodes/Rita and in ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'' [[Laura Dern]] plays Nikki Grace/Susan Blue. By contrast, Lynch rarely creates multi-character roles for his male actors.

===Recurring collaborators===
{{Main|Frequent David Lynch collaborators}}
Lynch is also widely noted for his collaborations with various production artists and composers on his films and other productions.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}  He frequently works with [[Angelo Badalamenti]] to compose music for his productions, former wife [[Mary Sweeney]] as a film editor, casting director [[Johanna Ray]], and cast members [[Harry Dean Stanton]], [[Jack Nance]], [[Kyle MacLachlan]], [[Naomi Watts]], [[Isabella Rossellini]], [[Grace Zabriskie]], and [[Laura Dern]].

==Other work==

===Painting===
[[File:Lynch's So This is Love painting.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Lynch's painting ''So This Is Love'', 1992]]
Lynch first trained as a painter, and although he is now better known as a filmmaker, he has continued to paint. Lynch has stated that "all my paintings are organic, violent comedies. They have to be violently done and primitive and crude, and to achieve that I try to let [[nature]] paint more than I paint."<ref name="lynch22">[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 22.</ref> Many of his works are very dark in colour, and Lynch has said this is because <blockquote>I wouldn't know what to do with [colour]. Colour to me is too real. It's limiting. It doesn't allow too much of a dream. The more you throw black into a colour, the more dreamy it gets&nbsp;... Black has depth. It's like a little egress; you can go into it, and because it keeps on continuing to be dark, the mind kicks in, and a lot of things that are going on in there become manifest. And you start seeing what you're afraid of. You start seeing what you love, and it becomes like a dream.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 20.</ref></blockquote>

Many of his works also contain letters and words added to the painting. He explains: <blockquote>The words in the paintings are sometimes important to make you start thinking about what else is going on in there. And a lot of times, the words excite me as shapes, and something'll grow out of that. I used to cut these little letters out and glue them on. They just look good all lined up like teeth&nbsp;... sometimes they become the title of the painting.<ref name="lynch22"/></blockquote>

Lynch considers the 20th-century Irish artist [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] to be his "number one kinda hero painter", stating that "Normally I only like a couple of years of a painter's work, but I like everything of Bacon's. The guy, you know, had the stuff."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 16–17.</ref>

Lynch was the subject of a major art retrospective at the [[Fondation Cartier]], Paris from March 3 – May 27, 2007. The show was titled ''The Air is on Fire'' and included numerous paintings, photographs, drawings, alternative films and sound work. New site-specific art [[Installation art|installations]] were created specially for the exhibition. A series of events accompanied the exhibition including live performances and concerts.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6412525.stm | work=BBC News | title=David Lynch's dark arts laid bare | date=March 2, 2007 | accessdate=May 1, 2010 | first=Caroline | last=Wyatt}}</ref>
Some of Lynch's art include photographs of dissected chickens and other animals as a "Build your own Chicken" toy ad.

His alma mater, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, presented an exhibition of his work, entitled "The Unified Field", which opened on September 12, 2014 and ends in January of 2015.

His favorite photographers include [[William Eggleston]] (''[[The Red Ceiling]]''), [[Joel-Peter Witkin]], and [[Diane Arbus]].<ref>[http://www.timeout.com/london/art/david-lynch-interview-there-is-something-so-incredibly-cosmically-magical-about-curtains David Lynch Interview - Art - Time Out London<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Music===
Lynch has also been involved in a number of music projects, many of them related to his films. His album genres switch mainly between [[experimental rock]], [[ambient music|ambient]] soundscapes and, most recently, avant-garde [[electro pop]] music. Most notably he produced and wrote lyrics for [[Julee Cruise]]'s first two albums, ''[[Floating into the Night]]'' (1989) and ''[[The Voice of Love]]'' (1993), in collaboration with [[Angelo Badalamenti]] who composed the music and also produced. Lynch also worked on the 1998 [[Jocelyn Montgomery]] album ''Lux Vivens''. For his own productions, he composed music for ''Wild at Heart'', ''Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me'', ''Mulholland Drive'', and ''Rabbits''. In 2001, he released ''[[BlueBob]]'', a rock album performed by Lynch and John Neff. The album is notable for Lynch's unusual guitar playing style. He plays "upside down and backwards, like a lap guitar", and relies heavily on effects pedals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lynchnet.com/articles/bug.html |title=BOSS Users Group magazine Vol. 5, No. 1 Summer 2001 |publisher=Lynchnet.com |date= |accessdate=July 6, 2011}}</ref> Most recently Lynch composed several pieces for ''Inland Empire'', including two songs, "Ghost of Love" and "Walkin' on the Sky", in which he makes his public debut as a singer. In 2009, his new book-CD set ''[[Danger Mouse and Sparklehorse Present: Dark Night of the Soul|Dark Night of the Soul]]'' was released.<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/05/15/danger-mouses-dark-night-of-the-soul-album-threatened-by-lawsuit/ Danger Mouse's Dark Night Of the Soul Album Threatened By Lawsuit]</ref> In 2008, he started his own record label called David Lynch MC which first released ''Fox Bat Strategy: A Tribute to Dave Jaurequi'' in early 2009. In August 2009, it was announced that he was releasing Afghani/American singer Ariana Delawari's ''Lion of Panjshir'' album in conjunction with [[Manimal Vinyl]] record company.

In November 2010, Lynch released two [[electro pop]] music singles, "Good Day Today" and "I Know", through the independent British label [[Sunday Best (music company)|Sunday Best Recordings]]. Describing why he created them, he stated that "I was just sitting and these notes came and then I went down and started working with Dean [Hurley, his engineer] and then these few notes, 'I want to have a good day, today' came and the song was built around that".<ref>{{Cite news | last = Topping | first = Alexandra|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/nov/28/david-lynch-turns-pop-singer-songwriter?intcmp=239 |title=The latest offbeat experiment from filmmaker David Lynch: pop singles |publisher=The Guardian |date=November 28, 2010 | accessdate=November 30, 2010 | location=London}}</ref> The singles were followed by an album, ''[[Crazy Clown Time]]'', which was released in November 2011 and described as an "electronic blues album".<ref name="clowntime">{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/13/arts/music/david-lynchs-album-crazy-clown-time.html?_r=1 | title=Music, Not Movies, But Still Exploring Places of Darkness | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 11, 2011 |accessdate=January 30, 2012 | first=David | last=Lynch}}</ref> The songs were sung by Lynch, with guest vocals on one track by [[Karen O]] of the [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15999-david-lynch-crazy-clown-time/ | last=Powell | first=Mike | title=Crazy Clown Time | publisher=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] |date=November 8, 2011 | accessdate=January 30, 2012}}</ref> and composed and performed by Lynch and [[Dean Hurley]].<ref name="clowntime"/>

On September 29, 2011, Lynch released ''This Train'' with vocalist and long-time musical collaborator [[Chrysta Bell]] on the La Rose Noire label.<ref>{{cite web|last=Battan|first=Carrie|title=David Lynch Unveils Album Cover Art|url=http://www.pitchfork.com/news/43992-david-lynch-unveils-album-cover-art/|publisher=Pitchfork}}</ref> The 11-song album was produced by Lynch and co-written primarily by Lynch and Bell.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dombal|first=Ryan|title=David Lynch Talks New Music Projects|url=http://www.pitchfork.com/news/40872-david-lynch-talks-new-music-projects/|publisher=Pitchfork}}</ref> It includes the song "Polish Poem" which is featured on the ''Inland Empire'' soundtrack.

Lynch's second studio album, ''[[The Big Dream]]'', was released in 2013 and included the single, "[[I'm Waiting Here]]", with Swedish singer-songwriter [[Lykke Li]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/50983-david-lynch-announces-new-album-the-big-dream-shares-track-featuring-lykke-li|title=David Lynch Announces New Album, The Big Dream, Shares Track Featuring Lykke Li &#124; News|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|last=Minkser|first=Evan|date=June 3, 2013|accessdate=June 3, 2013}}</ref> ''The Big Dream''{{'}}s release was preceded by ''TBD716'', an enigmatic 43-second video featured on Lynch's [[YouTube]] and [[Vine (app)|Vine]] accounts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mubi.com/notebook/posts/video-of-the-day-david-lynchs-tbd716|title=Video of the day: David Lynch's TBD716|work=Notebook|publisher=[[MUBI]]|date=May 31, 2013|accessdate=June 3, 2013}}</ref>

For Record Store Day 2014 David Lynch released ''The Big Dream Remix EP'' which featured four songs from his album remixed by various artists. This included the track "Are You Sure" remixed by [[Bastille (band)|Bastille]]. The band Bastille have been known to take inspiration from David Lynch's work for their songs and music videos, the main one being their song "Laura Palmer" which is influenced by Lynch's television show ''Twin Peaks''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nme.com/news/david-lynch/75997|title=David Lynch collaborates with Moby and Bastille for Record Store Day EP – listen}}</ref>

===Design===
Lynch designed and constructed furniture for his 1997 film ''Lost Highway'', notably the small table in the Madison house and the VCR case.

In April 1997 he presented a furniture collection at the prestigious [[Milan Furniture Fair]] in Italy. "Design and music, art and architecture – they all belong together."<ref>[http://cityofabsurdity.com/furniture.html The City Of Aburdity article-David Lynch Collection]</ref>

In 2011 Lynch signed a brand extension agreement licensing the name "Twin Peaks" for use in a Texas restaurant.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} While his involvement with the project was minimal, many fans expressed outrage. He has since said he regrets the move.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Working with designer Raphael Navot, architectural agency Enia and light designer Thierry Dreyfus, Lynch has conceived and designed a nightclub in Paris.<ref>[http://www.dezeen.com/2011/09/07/silencio-by-david-lynch/ Dezeen Magazine September 7, 2011]</ref> "Silencio" opened in October 2011, and is a private members' club although is free to the public after midnight.  Patrons have access to concerts, films and other performances by artists and guests.  Inspired by the club of the same name in his 2001 film ''Mulholland Drive'', the underground space consists of a series of rooms, each dedicated to a certain purpose or atmosphere. "Silencio is something dear to me. I wanted to create an intimate space where all the arts could come together. There won't be a Warhol-like guru, but it will be open to celebrated artists of all disciplines to come here to programme or create what they want."<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/aug/31/david-lynch-disco-paris?fb=native&CMP=FBCNETTXT9038/ The Guardian Aug 31, 2011]</ref>

===Literature===
In 2006, Lynch authored a short book describing his creative processes, stories from throughout his career, and the benefits he had realized through his practice of [[Transcendental Meditation]] called ''[[Catching the Big Fish|Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity]]''. He describes the metaphor behind the title in the introduction:

<blockquote>
Ideas are like fish.

If you want to catch little fish, you can stay in the shallow water. But if you want to catch the big fish, you've got to go deeper.

Down deep, the fish are more powerful and more pure. They're huge and abstract. And they're very beautiful.</blockquote>

The book weaves a non-linear autobiography with descriptions of Lynch's cognitive experiences during Transcendental Meditation.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lynch|first1=David|title=Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity|date=2006|publisher=The Penguin Group|isbn=978-1-58542-540-2|page=1|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qQqitBgFpOkC|accessdate=14 June 2014}}</ref> All author's royalties will be donated to the [[David Lynch Foundation]].

==Personal life==
Lynch has had several long-term relationships. In 1967, he married Peggy Lentz in Chicago, [[Illinois]].<ref>[http://www.peggyreavey.com/ Peggy Reavey Portfolio - The Truth, Portraits, Domestic, Mysticartoons, Mixed media., Words]</ref> They had one child, [[Jennifer Chambers Lynch]], born in 1968, who is a film director. They filed for divorce in 1974. On June 21, 1977, Lynch married Mary Fisk, and the couple had one child. They divorced in 1987, and Lynch began dating [[Isabella Rossellini]] after filming ''Blue Velvet''. Lynch and Rossellini broke up in 1991, and Lynch developed a relationship with [[Mary Sweeney]], with whom he had one son. Sweeney also worked as Lynch's longtime film editor/producer and co-wrote and produced ''[[The Straight Story]]''. The two married in May 2006, but divorced that July. Lynch married actress [[Emily Stofle]], who appeared in his 2006 film ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'', in February 2009. They have a daughter.

Lynch has said that he is "not a political person". However, he has expressed admiration for former US President [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref>{{cite web |last =Willow | first =Hank | url=http://www.hollywoodinvestigator.com/lynch.htm |title=Twin Peaks Director David Lynch - Admires Reagan, Natural Law Party |publisher=hollywoodinvestigator |date= November 19, 2001| accessdate=November 9, 2012}}</ref> Describing his political philosophy, he stated, "at that time, I thought of myself as a [[libertarianism|libertarian]]. I believed in next to zero government. And I still would lean toward no government and not so many rules, except for traffic lights and things like this. I really believe in traffic regulations."<ref name=reason>[http://reason.com/blog/2006/12/11/was-david-lynch-the-original-l Was David Lynch the Original Libertarian Democrat? - Hit & Run : Reason.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Lynch continued to state that "I don't know if there even is a [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian party]]. They wouldn't have a prayer of getting anywhere. So I'm a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] now. And I've always been a Democrat, really. But I don't like the Democrats a lot, either, because I'm a smoker, and I think a lot of the Democrats have come up with these rules for non-smoking."<ref name=reason/>

Lynch is working for the building and establishment of seven buildings, in which 8,000 salaried people will practice advanced meditation techniques, "pumping peace for the world". He estimates the cost at US$7 [[1,000,000,000|billion]]. As of December 2005, he had spent US$400,000 of personal money, and raised US$1 million in donations.<ref name="WP-12-01-2005" /> In December 2006, the ''New York Times'' reported that he continued to have that goal.<ref name="NYT-12-31-06" /> Lynch's book, ''[[Catching the Big Fish]]'' (Tarcher/Penguin 2006), discusses the impact of the Transcendental Meditation technique on his creative process. Lynch attended the funeral of the Maharishi in India in 2008.<ref name=Stevens/> He told a reporter, "In life, he revolutionised the lives of millions of people.&nbsp;...

On April 4, 2009, the "Change Begins Within" concert featured [[Paul McCartney]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Donovan]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Eddie Vedder]], [[Moby]], [[Bettye LaVette]], [[Ben Harper]], and [[Mike Love]] of the Beach Boys.<ref name="NYT-04-04-09">Jon Pareles, "[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/05/paul-mccartney-ringo-starr-reunite-at-radio-city Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr Reunite at Radio City]", ''New York Times'', April 4, 2009, Arts Section</ref> ''[[David Wants to Fly]]'', released in May 2010, is a documentary by German filmmaker David Sieveking "that follows the path of his professional idol, David Lynch, into the world of Transcendental Meditation (TM)."<ref>[http://german-documentaries.de/media/pdf/german-documentaries_10.pdf ''German Documentaries'', AGDF, March 2010."The young filmmaker David Sieveking follows the path of his professional idol, David Lynch, into the world of Transcendental Meditation (TM)."]</ref><ref>Variety, David Wants to Fly Review, Alissa Simon Feb 14, 2010 [http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117942181.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&nid=2562 Variety Reviews - David Wants to Fly - Film Reviews - Berlin - Review by Alissa Simon]{{Dead link|date=March 2013}}""David Wants to Fly" follows German writer-helmer David Sieveking on his road to enlightenment, a journey that involves David Lynch, various headquarters of the Transcendental Meditation (TM) movement and the icy source of the Ganges."</ref>

===Website===
Lynch designed his personal website, a site exclusive to paying members, where he posts short videos and his [[absurdism|absurdist]] series ''[[Dumbland]]'', plus interviews and other items. The site also featured a daily [[Weather forecasting|weather report]], where Lynch gives a brief description of the weather in Los Angeles, where he resides. Until June 2010, this weather report (usually no longer than 30&nbsp;seconds) was also being broadcast on his personal [[YouTube]] channel, ''David Lynch – Daily Weather Report''.<ref>{{YouTube|user=DLDWR|title=David Lynch – Daily Weather Report}}{{Dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> An absurd [[ringtone]] ("I like to kill deer") from the website was a common [[sound bite]] on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' in early 2006.

Lynch is a coffee drinker and even has his own line of special organic blends available for purchase on his website. Called "David Lynch Signature Cup", the coffee has been advertised via flyers included with several recent Lynch-related DVD releases, including ''Inland Empire'' and the Gold Box edition of ''Twin Peaks''. The possibly self-mocking tag-line for the brand is "It's all in the beans&nbsp;... and I'm just full of beans."<ref>David Lynch Signature Cup flyer, included with the ''Twin Peaks'' Definitive Gold Box Edition DVD set, October 2007, the digitally remastered ''[[Eraserhead]]'' DVD in 2006, and in other Lynch DVD releases in 2005–2007.</ref> This is also a quote of a line said by [[Justin Theroux]]'s character in ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]''.
