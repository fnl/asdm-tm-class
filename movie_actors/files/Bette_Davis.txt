'''Ruth Elizabeth Davis''' (April 5, 1908 – October 6, 1989), known as '''Bette Davis''', was an American actress of film, television and theater. Regarded as one of the greatest actors in cinema history, she was noted for her willingness to play unsympathetic, sardonic characters and was reputed for her performances in a range of film genres, from contemporary crime melodramas to [[historical film|historical]] and period films and occasional comedies, although her greatest successes were her roles in romantic dramas.<ref>{{cite book |last= Michele Bourgoin|first= Suzanne |title= Encyclopedia of World Biography|year= 1998 |publisher= Gale |isbn=0787622214|page=119}}</ref>

After appearing in [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] plays, Davis moved to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] in 1930, but her early films for [[Universal Studios]] (and as loanout to other studios) were unsuccessful. She joined [[Warner Bros.]] in 1932 and established her career with several critically acclaimed performances. In 1937 she attempted to free herself from her contract and although she lost a well-publicized legal case, it marked the beginning of the most successful period of her career. Until the late 1940s, she was one of American cinema's most celebrated leading ladies, known for her forceful and intense style. Davis gained a reputation as a perfectionist who could be highly combative, and confrontations with studio executives, film directors and costars were often reported. Her forthright manner, clipped vocal style and ubiquitous cigarette contributed to a public persona which has often been imitated and parodied.

Davis was the co-founder of the [[Hollywood Canteen]], and was the first female president of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]. She won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] twice, was the first person to accrue 10 [[Academy Award]] nominations for acting, and was the first woman to receive a [[AFI Life Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]] from the [[American Film Institute]]. Her career went through several periods of eclipse, and she admitted that her success had often been at the expense of her personal relationships. Married four times, she was once widowed and thrice divorced, and raised her children as a single parent. Her final years were marred by a long period of ill health, but she continued acting until shortly before her death from [[breast cancer]], with more than 100 films, television and theater roles to her credit.
In 1999 Davis was placed second on the American Film Institute's list of the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars|greatest female stars of all time]].

==Life and career==

===Background and early acting career (1908–1929)===
Ruth Elizabeth Davis, known from early childhood as "Betty," was born at 55 Cedar Street, [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], the daughter of Harlow Morrell Davis, a law student from [[Augusta, Maine]], and Ruth Augusta "Ruthie" ([[married and maiden names|née]] Favor), from [[Tyngsboro, Massachusetts]].<ref>ancestry.com Massachusetts 1840-1915 birth records, page 448 of book registered in Somerville</ref> Betty's younger sister, Barbara Harriet "Bobby", was born October 25, 1909, at 55 Ward Street in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]], by which time their father was a patent attorney.<ref>ancestry.com Massachusetts Birth Records 1840-1915 page 1235</ref> In 1915, Davis's parents separated and Betty and Bobby attended a Spartan boarding school called Crestalban in [[Lanesborough, Massachusetts|Lanesborough]], which is located in the [[Berkshires]].<ref>Sikov (2007), pp. 14–15</ref> In 1921, Ruth Davis moved to [[New York City]] with her daughters, where she worked as a portrait photographer. Betty was inspired to become an actress after seeing [[Rudolph Valentino]] in ''[[The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1921 film)|The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]'' (1921) and [[Mary Pickford]] in ''[[Little Lord Fauntleroy]]'' (1921),<ref>Spada (1993), p. 20</ref> and changed the spelling of her name to "Bette" after [[Honoré de Balzac]]'s ''[[La Cousine Bette]]''.<ref>Chandler (2006), p. 34</ref> She received encouragement from her mother, who had aspired to become an actress.

She attended [[Cushing Academy]], a boarding school in [[Ashburnham, Massachusetts]], where she met her future husband, Harmon O. Nelson, known as "Ham." In 1926, she saw a production of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[The Wild Duck]]'' with [[Blanche Yurka]] and [[Peg Entwistle]], a well-known Broadway actress who, in 1932 killed herself by jumping off the H of the [[Hollywood Sign]]. Davis later recalled that she inspired her full commitment to her chosen career, and said, "Before that Entwistle."<ref>Chandler (2006), pp. 38–39</ref> She auditioned for admission to [[Eva LeGallienne]]'s Manhattan Civic Repertory, but was rejected by LeGallienne who described her attitude as "insincere" and "frivolous."<ref>Spada (1993), p. 40</ref> She was accepted by the [[John Murray Anderson]] School of Theatre, and studied dance with [[Martha Graham]].

She auditioned for [[George Cukor]]'s stock theater company, and although he was not very impressed, he gave Davis her first paid acting assignment anyway—a one-week stint playing the part of a chorus girl in the play ''Broadway.'' She was later chosen to play Hedwig, the character she had seen Entwistle play, in ''The Wild Duck.'' After performing in Philadelphia, Washington and Boston, she made her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in 1929 in ''Broken Dishes,'' and followed it with ''Solid South.'' A Universal Studios talent scout saw her perform and invited her to Hollywood for a [[screen test]].

===Early years in Hollywood (1930–1936)===
[[File:Bette davis bad sister.jpg|thumb|upright|Davis in her film debut, ''[[The Bad Sister]]'' (1931)]]

Accompanied by her mother, Davis traveled by train to Hollywood, arriving on December 13, 1930. She later recounted her surprise that nobody from the studio was there to meet her; a studio employee had waited for her, but left because he saw nobody who "looked like an actress." She failed her first screen test but was used in several screen tests for other actors. In a 1971 interview with [[Dick Cavett]], she related the experience with the observation, "I was the most Yankee-est, most modest virgin who ever walked the earth. They laid me on a couch, and I tested fifteen men&nbsp;...&nbsp;They all had to lie on top of me and give me a passionate kiss. Oh, I thought I would die. Just thought I would die."<ref>Stine (1974), pp. 2–3</ref> A second test was arranged for Davis, for the 1931 film ''[[A House Divided (1931 film)|A House Divided]]''. Hastily dressed in an ill-fitting costume with a low neckline, she was rebuffed by the [[film director|director]] [[William Wyler]], who loudly commented to the assembled crew, "What do you think of these dames who show their chests and think they can get jobs?"<ref>Chandler (2006), p. 68</ref>

[[Carl Laemmle]], the head of Universal Studios, considered terminating Davis's employment, but [[cinematographer]] [[Karl Freund]] told him she had "lovely eyes" and would be suitable for ''[[The Bad Sister]]'' (1931), in which she subsequently made her film debut.<ref>Chandler (2006), p. 67</ref> Her nervousness was compounded when she overheard the Chief of Production, [[Carl Laemmle, Jr.]], comment to another executive that she had "about as much sex appeal as [[Slim Summerville]]," one of the film's co-stars.<ref>Stine (1974), p. 10</ref> The film was not a success, and her next role in ''[[Seed (1931 film)|Seed]]'' (1931) was too brief to attract attention.

Universal Studios renewed her contract for three months, and she appeared in a small role in ''[[Waterloo Bridge (1931 film)|Waterloo Bridge]]'' (1931) before being lent to [[Columbia Pictures]] for ''[[The Menace (film)|The Menace]]'' and to Capital Films for ''[[Hell's House]]'' (all 1932). After nine months, and six unsuccessful films, Laemmle elected not to renew her contract.

Davis was preparing to return to New York when actor [[George Arliss]] chose Davis for the lead female role in the [[Warner Brothers Studio|Warner Brothers]] picture ''[[The Man Who Played God (1932 film)|The Man Who Played God]]'' (1932), and for the rest of her life, Davis credited him with helping her achieve her "break" in Hollywood. ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' wrote, "she is not only beautiful, but she bubbles with charm," and compared her to [[Constance Bennett]] and [[Olive Borden]].<ref>Stine (1974), p. 20</ref> Warner Bros. signed her to a five-year contract, and she remained with the studio for the next eighteen years, garnering great acclaim for herself as well as making a fortune for her employers.

In 1932 she married Harmon "Ham" Nelson, who was scrutinized by the press; his $100 a week earnings compared unfavorably with Davis's reported $1,000 a week income. Davis addressed the issue in an interview, pointing out that many Hollywood wives earned more than their husbands, but the situation proved difficult for Nelson, who refused to allow Davis to purchase a house until he could afford to pay for it himself.<ref>Spada (1993), pp. 94–98</ref> Davis had several abortions during the marriage.<ref>Moseley, Roy. ''Bette Davis''. Lexington: University of Kentucky Press, 2003. p. 103.</ref>

[[File:Bette davis of human bondage.jpg|left|thumb|As the shrewish Mildred in ''[[Of Human Bondage (1934 film)|Of Human Bondage]]'' (1934), Davis was acclaimed for her dramatic performance]]

After more than 20&nbsp;film roles, the role of the vicious and slatternly Mildred Rogers in the RKO Radio production of ''[[Of Human Bondage (1934 film)|Of Human Bondage]]'' (1934), a film adaptation of [[W. Somerset Maugham]]'s novel, earned Davis her first major critical acclaim. Many actresses feared playing unsympathetic characters and several had refused the role, but Davis viewed it as an opportunity to show the range of her acting skills. Her co-star, [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]], was initially dismissive of her, but as filming progressed his attitude changed and he subsequently spoke highly of her abilities. The director, [[John Cromwell (director)|John Cromwell]], allowed her relative freedom, and commented, "I let Bette have her head. I trusted her instincts." She insisted that she be portrayed realistically in her death scene, and said, "the last stages of [[tubercolosis|consumption]], poverty and neglect are not pretty and I intended to be convincing-looking."<ref>Spada (1993), pp. 102–07</ref>

The film was a success, and Davis's confronting characterization won praise from critics, with ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine writing that she gave "probably the best performance ever recorded on the screen by a U.S. actress."<ref>Ringgold (1966), p. 57</ref> Davis anticipated that her reception would encourage Warner Bros. to cast her in more important roles, and was disappointed when [[Jack Warner]] refused to lend her to Columbia Studios to appear in ''[[It Happened One Night]],'' and instead cast her in the [[melodrama]] ''[[Housewife (film)|Housewife]]''.<ref>Chandler (2006), p. 102</ref> When Davis was not nominated for an Academy Award for ''Of Human Bondage,'' ''The Hollywood Citizen News'' questioned the omission and [[Norma Shearer]], herself a nominee, joined a campaign to have Davis nominated. This prompted an announcement from the Academy president, [[Howard Estabrook]], who said that under the circumstances "any voter&nbsp;...&nbsp;may write on the ballot his or her personal choice for the winners," thus allowing, for the only time in the Academy's history, the consideration of a candidate not officially nominated for an award.<ref name="Wiley">Wiley (1987), p. 55</ref> [[Claudette Colbert]] won the award for ''It Happened One Night'' but the uproar led to a change in Academy voting procedures the following year, whereby nominations were determined by votes from all eligible members of a particular branch, rather than by a smaller committee,<ref>Spada (1993), p. 107</ref> with results independently tabulated by the accounting firm [[Price Waterhouse]].<ref>Wiley (1987), p. 58</ref>

Davis appeared in ''[[Dangerous (film)|Dangerous]]'' (1935) as a troubled actress and received very good reviews. E. Arnot Robertson wrote in ''Picture Post,'' "I think Bette Davis would probably have been burned as a witch if she had lived two or three hundred years ago. She gives the curious feeling of being charged with power which can find no ordinary outlet." ''[[The New York Times]]'' hailed her as "becoming one of the most interesting of our screen actresses."<ref>Ringgold (1966), p. 65</ref> She won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for the role, but commented it was belated recognition for ''Of Human Bondage,'' calling the award a "consolation prize."<ref>Baxter, John (1968). ''Hollywood in the Thirties,'' p.128. A. Zwemmer Limited, London. ISBN 0-498-06927-3.</ref> For the rest of her life, Davis maintained that she gave the statue its familiar name of "Oscar" because its posterior resembled that of her husband, whose middle name was Oscar,<ref>Sikov (2007), p. 80</ref><ref>Chandler (2006), pp. 101, 263</ref> although her claim has been disputed by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, among others.

In her next film, ''[[The Petrified Forest]]'' (1936), Davis co-starred with Leslie Howard and [[Humphrey Bogart]], but Bogart, in his first important role, received most of the critics' praise. Davis appeared in several films over the next two years but most were poorly received.

====Legal case====
Convinced that her career was being damaged by a succession of mediocre films, Davis accepted an offer in 1936 to appear in two films in Britain. Knowing that she was breaching her contract with [[Warner Bros.]], she fled to [[Canada]] to avoid legal papers being served upon her. Eventually, Davis brought her case to court in Britain, hoping to get out of her contract with Warner Bros.<ref name="sperling">Sperling, Millner, and Warner, pp. 219–21.</ref> She later recalled the opening statement of the barrister, Sir [[Patrick Hastings]], who represented Warner Bros. Hastings urged the court to "come to the conclusion that this is rather a naughty young lady and that what she wants is more money." He mocked Davis's description of her contract as "slavery" by stating, incorrectly, that she was being paid $1,350 per week. He remarked, "if anybody wants to put me into perpetual servitude on the basis of that remuneration, I shall prepare to consider it." The British press offered little support to Davis, and portrayed her as overpaid and ungrateful.<ref>Spada (1993), pp. 124–25</ref>

Davis explained her viewpoint to a journalist, saying "I knew that, if I continued to appear in any more mediocre pictures, I would have no career left worth fighting for."<ref>Stine (1974), p. 68</ref> Davis's counsel presented her complaints—that she could be suspended without pay for refusing a part, with the period of suspension added to her contract, that she could be called upon to play any part within her abilities regardless of her personal beliefs, that she could be required to support a political party against her beliefs, and that her image and likeness could be displayed in any manner deemed applicable by the studio. Jack Warner testified, and was asked, "Whatever part you choose to call upon her to play, if she thinks she can play it, whether it is distasteful and cheap, she has to play it?" Warner replied, "Yes, she must play it."<ref>Spada (1993), p. 127</ref> The case, decided by Branson J. in the English High Court, was reported as ''Warner Bros. Studios Incorporated v. Nelson'' in [1937] 1 KB 209. Davis lost the case and returned to Hollywood, in debt and without income, to resume her career. [[Olivia de Havilland]] mounted a similar case in 1943 and won.

===Success with Warner Bros. (1937–1941)===
Davis began work on ''[[Marked Woman]]'' (1937), as a prostitute in a contemporary gangster drama inspired by the case of [[Lucky Luciano]]. For her performance in the film she was awarded the [[Volpi Cup]] at the 1937 [[Venice Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/history/volpi.html?back=true|title=The awards of the Venice Film Festival|publisher=La Biennale di Venezia|accessdate=2011-12-14}}</ref> Her next picture was ''[[Jezebel (film)|Jezebel]]'' (1938), and during production Davis entered a relationship with director [[William Wyler]]. She later described him as the "love of my life," and said that making the film with him was "the time in my life of my most perfect happiness."<ref>Chandler (2006), p. 121</ref> The film was a success, and Davis' performance as a spoiled [[Southern belle]] earned her a second Academy Award, which led to speculation in the press that she would be chosen to play a similar character, [[Scarlett O'Hara]], in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]].'' Davis expressed her desire to play Scarlett, and while [[David O. Selznick]] was conducting a search for the actress to play the role, a radio poll named her as the audience favorite. Warners offered her services to Selznick as part of a deal that also included [[Errol Flynn]] and [[Olivia de Havilland]], but Selznick did not consider Davis as suitable, and rejected the offer,<ref>Haver (1980), p. 243</ref> while Davis did not want Flynn cast as [[Rhett Butler]]. Newcomer [[Vivien Leigh]] was eventually cast as Scarlett O'Hara, while de Havilland landed a role as Melanie, and both of them would be nominated for the [[Oscars]], with Leigh winning.

''Jezebel'' marked the beginning of the most successful phase of Davis' career, and over the next few years she was listed in the annual "Quigley Poll of the Top Ten Money Making Stars," which was compiled from the votes of movie exhibitors throughout the U.S. for the stars that had generated the most revenue in their theaters over the previous year.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html | title = The 2006 Motion Picture Almanac, Top Ten Money Making Stars |work= Quigley Publishing Company | accessdate = 2008-08-24 }}</ref> In contrast to Davis' success, her husband, Ham Nelson, had failed to establish a career for himself, and their relationship faltered. In 1938, Nelson obtained evidence that Davis was engaged in a sexual relationship with [[Howard Hughes]] and subsequently filed for divorce citing Davis' "cruel and inhuman manner."<ref>{{cite book |last= Spada |first= James |title= More Than a Woman |year= 1993 |publisher= Little, Brown and Company |isbn= 0-316-90880-0 |pages= 144–148}}</ref>

[[File:Bette Davis - Errol Flynn.jpg|thumb|200px|with [[Errol Flynn]] in ''[[The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex]]'' (1939)]]

She was emotional during the making of her next film, ''[[Dark Victory]]'' (1939), and considered abandoning it until the producer [[Hal B. Wallis]] convinced her to channel her despair into her acting. The film became one of the highest grossing films of the year, and the role of Judith Traherne brought her an Academy Award nomination. In later years, Davis cited this performance as her personal favorite.<ref>Chandler (2006), p. 131</ref> She appeared in three other box office hits in 1939, ''[[The Old Maid (1939 film)|The Old Maid]]'' with [[Miriam Hopkins]], ''[[Juarez (film)|Juarez]]'' with [[Paul Muni]] and ''[[The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex]]'' with Errol Flynn. The latter was her first color film and her only color film made during the height of her career. To play the elderly [[Elizabeth I of England]], Davis shaved her hairline and eyebrows. During filming she was visited on the set by the actor [[Charles Laughton]]. She commented that she had a "nerve" playing a woman in her sixties, to which Laughton replied, "Never not dare to hang yourself. That's the only way you grow in your profession. You must continually attempt things that you think are beyond you, or you get into a complete rut." Recalling the episode many years later, Davis remarked that Laughton's advice had influenced her throughout her career.<ref>Chandler (2006), p. 141</ref>

By this time, Davis was Warner Bros.' most profitable star, and she was given the most important of their female leading roles. Her image was considered with more care; although she continued to play character roles, she was often filmed in close-ups that emphasized her distinctive eyes. ''[[All This and Heaven Too]]'' (1940) was the most financially successful film of Davis' career to that point, while ''[[The Letter (1940 film)|The Letter]]'' (1940) was considered "one of the best pictures of the year" by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]],'' and Davis won admiration for her portrayal of an adulterous killer, a role originated by famed actress [[Katharine Cornell]].<ref>Ringgold (1966), p. 105</ref> During this time, she was in a relationship with her former costar [[George Brent]], who proposed marriage. Davis refused, as she had met Arthur Farnsworth, a [[New England]] innkeeper. Davis and Farnsworth were married at Home Ranch, in [[Rimrock, Arizona]], in December 1940.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat=19401230&id=tgQyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=POIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3478,481968|title=Reading Eagle - Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Bette davis the little foxes.jpg|thumb|left|Davis often played unlikable characters, such as Regina Giddens in ''[[The Little Foxes (film)|The Little Foxes]]'' (1941)]]

In January 1941, Davis became the first female president of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] but antagonized the committee members with her brash manner and radical proposals. Faced with the disapproval and resistance of the committee, Davis resigned, and was succeeded by her predecessor [[Walter Wanger]]. Davis starred in three movies in 1941, the first being ''[[The Great Lie]],'' opposite George Brent. It was a refreshingly different role for Davis, as she played a kind, sympathetic character. Brent tickled Davis during many of the film's scenes, which allowed the audience, used to Davis' strong-willed character, a rare glimpse of her succumbing to giggles and squirms.

William Wyler directed Davis for the third time in [[Lillian Hellman]]'s ''[[The Little Foxes (film)|The Little Foxes]]'' ([[RKO]], 1941), but they clashed over the character of Regina Giddens. Taking a role originally played on stage by [[Tallulah Bankhead]], Davis felt Bankhead's original interpretation was appropriate and followed Hellman's intent, but Wyler wanted her to soften the character. Davis refused to compromise. She received another Academy Award nomination for her performance, and never worked with Wyler again.

===War effort and personal tragedy (1942–1944)===
Following the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], Davis spent the early months of 1942 selling [[war bonds]]. After Jack Warner criticized her tendency to cajole crowds into buying, she reminded him that her audiences responded most strongly to her "[[Bitch (insult)|bitch]]" performances. She sold two million dollars worth of bonds in two days, as well as a picture of herself in ''Jezebel'' for $250,000. She also performed for black regiments as the only white member of an acting troupe formed by [[Hattie McDaniel]], which included [[Lena Horne]] and [[Ethel Waters]].<ref>Spada (1993), pp. 191–92</ref>

At [[John Garfield]]'s suggestion of opening a servicemen's club in Hollywood, Davis—with the aid of Warner, [[Cary Grant]] and [[Jule Styne]]—transformed an old nightclub into the [[Hollywood Canteen]], which opened on October 3, 1942. Hollywood's most important stars volunteered to entertain servicemen. Davis ensured that every night there would be a few important "names" for the visiting soldiers to meet.<ref>Spada (1993), pp. 191–93</ref> She appeared as herself in the film ''[[Hollywood Canteen (1944 film)|Hollywood Canteen]]'' (1944), which used the canteen as the setting for a fictional story. Davis later commented, "There are few accomplishments in my life that I am sincerely proud of. The Hollywood Canteen is one of them." In 1980, she was awarded the [[Department of Defense Distinguished Civilian Service Award|Distinguished Civilian Service Medal]], the [[United States Department of Defense]]'s highest civilian award, for her work with the Hollywood Canteen.<ref name="BetteDavisofficialsite">{{cite web | url =http://www.bettedavis.com/about/bio.htm | title = Bette Davis official site| publisher=Estate of Bette Davis| accessdate = 2008-08-24| archiveurl =//web.archive.org/web/20080723014931/http://www.bettedavis.com/about/bio.htm <!--Added by H3llBot-->| archivedate =2008-07-23}}</ref>

[[File:Davis henreid now voyager.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Paul Henreid]] lights Davis' cigarette in ''[[Now, Voyager]]'' (1942), one of her most iconic roles.]]

Davis showed little interest in the film ''[[Now, Voyager]]'' (1942) until [[Hal Wallis]] advised her that female audiences needed romantic dramas to distract them from the reality of their lives. It became one of the best known of her "women's pictures." In one of the film's most imitated scenes, [[Paul Henreid]] lights two cigarettes as he stares into Davis' eyes and passes one to her. Film reviewers complimented Davis on her performance, the ''National Board of Review'' commenting that she gave the film "a dignity not fully warranted by the script."<ref>Ringgold (1966), p. 120</ref>

During the early 1940s, several of Davis' film choices were influenced by the war, such as ''[[Watch on the Rhine]]'' (1943), by Lillian Hellman, and ''[[Thank Your Lucky Stars (1943 film)|Thank Your Lucky Stars]]'' (1943), a lighthearted all-star musical [[cavalcade]], with each of the featured stars donating their fee to the Hollywood Canteen. Davis performed a novelty song, "They're Either Too Young or Too Old," which became a hit record after the film's release. ''[[Old Acquaintance]]'' (1943) reunited her with Miriam Hopkins in a story of two old friends who deal with the tensions created when one of them becomes a successful novelist. Davis felt that Hopkins tried to upstage her throughout the film. Director [[Vincent Sherman]] recalled the intense competitiveness and animosity between the two actresses, and Davis often joked that she held back nothing in a scene in which she was required to shake Hopkins in a fit of anger.<ref>Spada (1993), pp. 198–200</ref>

In August 1943, Davis' husband, Arthur Farnsworth, collapsed while walking along a Hollywood street and died two days later. An [[autopsy]] revealed that his fall had been caused by a skull fracture he had suffered two weeks earlier. Davis testified before an [[inquest]] that she knew of no event that might have caused the injury. A finding of accidental death was reached. Highly distraught, Davis attempted to withdraw from her next film ''[[Mr. Skeffington]]'' (1944); but Jack Warner, who had halted production following Farnsworth's death, convinced her to continue. Although she had gained a reputation for being forthright and demanding, her behavior during filming of ''Mr. Skeffington'' was erratic and out of character. She alienated Vincent Sherman by refusing to film certain scenes and insisting that some sets be rebuilt. She improvised dialogue, causing confusion among other actors, and infuriated the writer, [[Julius J. Epstein|Julius Epstein]], who was called upon to rewrite scenes at her whim. Davis later explained her actions with the observation, "when I was most unhappy I lashed out rather than whined." Some reviewers criticized Davis for the excess of her performance; [[James Agee]] wrote that she "demonstrates the horrors of egocentricity on a marathonic scale;"<ref>Spada (1993), pp. 218–25</ref> but despite the mixed reviews, she received another Academy Award nomination.

===Professional setbacks (1945–1949)===
[[File:Bette davis the corn is green.jpg|thumb|upright|left|In ''[[The Corn Is Green (1945 film)|The Corn Is Green]]'' (1945). Despite the studio's suggestion that Davis play the role as a young woman, the 38-year-old insisted on aging her appearance to fit the part.]]

In 1945 Davis married artist [[William Grant Sherry]], who also, when necessary, worked as a masseur. She had been drawn to him because he claimed he had never heard of her and was, therefore, not intimidated by her.<ref>Spada (1993), pp. 254–55</ref> The same year, Davis refused the title role in ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945),<ref>Spada (1993), p. 247</ref> a role for which [[Joan Crawford]] won an [[Academy Award]], and instead made ''[[The Corn Is Green (1945 film)|The Corn Is Green]]'' (1945) based on a play by [[Emlyn Williams]]. Davis played Miss Moffat, an English teacher who saves a young [[Wales|Welsh]] miner ([[John Dall]]) from a life in the coal pits, by offering him education. The part had been played in the theatre by [[Ethel Barrymore]], but Warner Bros. felt that the film version should depict the character as a younger woman. Davis disagreed and insisted on playing the part as written and wore a gray wig and padding under her clothes, to create a dowdy appearance.<ref>Spada, p. 227</ref> The film was well received by critics and made a profit of $2.2 million.<ref>Spada, p. 229</ref> The critic [[E. Arnot Robertson]] observed that "only Bette Davis . . . could have combated so successfully the obvious intention of the adaptors of the play to make frustrated sex the mainspring of the chief character's interest in the young miner." She concluded that "the subtle interpretation she insisted on giving" kept the focus on the teacher's "sheer joy in imparting knowledge."<ref>Ringgold, p. 133</ref>

Her next film, ''[[A Stolen Life (1946 film)|A Stolen Life]]'' (1946), was the first and only film that Davis made with her own production company, BD Productions.<ref>Sikov, p. 250</ref> Davis played dual roles, as twins. The film received poor reviews and was described by [[Bosley Crowther]] as "a distressingly empty piece;"<ref>Ringgold, p. 135</ref> but, with a profit of $2.5 million, it was one of her biggest box-office successes.<ref>Spada, p. 238</ref> In 1947, the [[U.S. Treasury]] named Davis as the highest paid woman in the country,<ref>Stine, p. 197</ref> with her share of the film's profit accounting for most of her earnings. Her next film was ''[[Deception (1946 film)|Deception]]'' (1946), the first of her films to lose money.<ref>Spada (1993), p. 241</ref>

''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947) had been tailor-made for Davis<ref>Bret (2006), p. 168</ref> and was to have been her next project after ''Deception.'' However, she was pregnant and went on maternity leave. Joan Crawford played her role in ''Possessed'' and was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Actress. In 1947, at the age of 39, Davis gave birth to a daughter, [[B. D. Hyman|Barbara Davis Sherry]] (known as B.D.) and later wrote in her memoir that she became absorbed in motherhood and considered ending her career. However, her relationship with Sherry began to deteriorate and she continued making films, but her popularity with audiences was steadily declining.<ref>Spada (1993), pp. 246–47</ref>

Among the film roles offered to Davis following her return to film making was Rose Sayer in ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (1951). When informed that the film was to be shot in [[Africa]], Davis refused the part, telling Jack Warner, "If you can't shoot the picture in a boat on the back lot, then I'm not interested." [[Katharine Hepburn]] played the role and was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Actress.<ref>Considine (2000), p. 225</ref> Davis was also offered a role in a film version of the [[Virginia Kellogg]] prison drama ''Women Without Men.'' Originally intended to pair Davis with Joan Crawford, Davis made it clear that she would not appear in any "[[Dyke (slang)|dyke]] movie." It was filmed as ''[[Caged]]'' (1950), and the lead roles were played by [[Eleanor Parker]] (who was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Actress) and [[Agnes Moorehead]].<ref>Bret (2006), p. 176</ref> She lobbied Jack Warner to make two films, ''[[Ethan Frome]]'' and a biography of [[Mary Todd Lincoln]]; however, Warner vetoed each proposal.

[[File:Bette davis beyond the forest.jpg|thumb|''[[Beyond the Forest]]'' (1949) was the last film Davis made for Warner Bros., after 17 years with the studio]]
In 1948 Davis was cast in the [[melodrama]] ''[[Winter Meeting]];'' and, although she was initially enthusiastic, she soon learned that Warner had arranged for "softer" lighting to be used to disguise her age. She recalled that she had seen the same lighting technique "on the sets of [[Ruth Chatterton]] and [[Kay Francis]], and I knew what they meant."<ref>Spada (1993), p. 250</ref> She began to regret accepting the role; and, to add to her disappointment, she was not confident in the abilities of her leading man, [[Jim Davis (actor)|James Davis]] in his first major screen role. She disagreed with amendments made to the script because of censorship restrictions and found that many of the aspects of the role that had initially appealed to her had been cut. The film was later described by [[Bosley Crowther]] as "interminable;" and he noted that "of all the miserable dilemmas in which Miss Davis has been involved&nbsp;...&nbsp;this one is probably the worst". It failed at the box office, and the studio lost nearly one million dollars.<ref>Spada (1993), pp. 250–51</ref>

While making ''[[June Bride]]'' (1948), Davis clashed with co-star [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]], later describing him as "a male Miriam Hopkins... an excellent actor, but addicted to [[Scene stealer|scene-stealing]]."<ref>Chandler (2006), pp. 247–48</ref> The film marked her first comedy in several years and earned her some positive reviews; but it was not particularly popular with audiences and returned only a small profit. Despite the lackluster box office receipts from her more recent films, in 1949, she negotiated a four-film contract with Warner Bros., which paid $10,285 per week and made her the highest-paid woman in the United States.<ref>Spada (1993), p. 257</ref> Jack Warner refused to allow her script approval, however, and cast her in ''[[Beyond the Forest]]'' (1949). Davis reportedly loathed the script and begged Warner to recast the role, but he refused. After the film was completed, Warner released Davis from her contract, at her request. The reviews that followed were scathing; Dorothy Manners writing for the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|Los Angeles Examiner]]'' described the film as "an unfortunate finale to her brilliant career." <ref>Ringgold (1966), p. 143</ref> [[Hedda Hopper]] wrote, "If Bette had deliberately set out to wreck her career, she could not have picked a more appropriate vehicle."<ref>Spada (1993), p. 285</ref> The film contained the line, "What a dump!," which became closely associated with Davis after it was referenced in [[Edward Albee]]'s ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]],'' and impersonators began to use it in their acts. In later years, Davis often used it as her opening line at speaking engagements.

===Starting a freelance career (1949–1960)===
[[File:Bette Davis and Gary Merrill in All About Eve.jpg|thumb|Davis posing as Margo Channing in a promotional image for ''[[All About Eve]]'' (1950). She is pictured with [[Gary Merrill]], to whom she was married from 1950 to 1960 (her fourth and final husband)]]

By 1949 Davis and Sherry were estranged and Hollywood columnists were writing that Davis' career was at an end. She filmed ''The Story of a Divorce'' (released by RKO Radio Pictures in 1951 as ''[[Payment on Demand]]'') but had received no other offers. Her box office appeal had noticeably dropped and she was labeled "[[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|Box Office Poison]]" as was [[Shirley Temple]], [[Sylvia Sidney]], [[James Cagney]], and [[Henry Fonda]] among others.

Shortly before filming was completed, the producer [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] offered her the role of the aging theatrical actress Margo Channing in ''[[All About Eve]]'' (1950). [[Claudette Colbert]], for whom the part had been written, had severely injured her back, and she was unable to continue. Davis read the script, described it as the best she had ever read, and accepted the role. Within days she joined the cast in [[San Francisco]] to begin filming. During production, she established what would become a lifelong friendship with her co-star, [[Anne Baxter]], and a romantic relationship with her leading man, [[Gary Merrill]], which led to marriage. The film's director [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]] later remarked, "Bette was letter perfect. She was syllable-perfect. The director's dream: the prepared actress."<ref>Staggs (2000), p. 80</ref>

Critics responded positively to Davis' performance and several of her lines became well-known, particularly, "Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night." She was again nominated for an Academy Award and critics such as Gene Ringgold described her Margo as her "all-time best performance."<ref>Ringgold (1966), p. 150</ref> [[Pauline Kael]] wrote that much of Mankiewicz' vision of "the theater" was "nonsense" but commended Davis, writing "[the film is] saved by one performance that is the real thing: Bette Davis is at her most instinctive and assured. Her actress—vain, scared, a woman who goes too far in her reactions and emotions—makes the whole thing come alive."<ref>Kael (1982), p. 13</ref> Davis won a [[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actress]] award from the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award]]. She also received the [[San Francisco Film Critics Circle Awards|San Francisco Film Critics Circle Award]] as "Best Actress", having been named by them as the "Worst Actress" of 1949 for ''Beyond the Forest''. During this time she was invited to leave her handprints in the forecourt of [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]].

On July 3, 1950, Davis' divorce from William Sherry was finalized, and on July 28 she married Gary Merrill. With Sherry's consent, Merrill adopted B.D., Davis' daughter with Sherry, and in 1950, Davis and Merrill adopted a baby girl they named Margot. The family traveled to England, where Davis and Merrill starred in a murder-mystery film, ''[[Another Man's Poison]]'' (1951). When it received lukewarm reviews and failed at the box office, Hollywood columnists wrote that Davis' comeback had petered out, and an Academy Award nomination for ''[[The Star (1952 film)|The Star]]'' (1952) did not halt her decline.

Davis and Merrill adopted a baby boy, Michael, in 1952, and Davis appeared in a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[revue]], ''[[Two's Company (musical)|Two's Company]]'' directed by [[Jules Dassin]]. She was uncomfortable working outside of her area of expertise; she had never been a musical performer and her limited theater experience had been more than 20&nbsp;years earlier. She was also severely ill and was operated on for [[osteomyelitis]] of the jaw. Margot was diagnosed as severely brain damaged due to an injury sustained during or shortly after her birth, and was eventually placed in an institution. Davis and Merrill began arguing frequently, with B.D. later recalling episodes of [[alcohol abuse]] and [[domestic violence]].<ref>Spada (1993), pp. 310–15</ref>

Few of Davis' films of the 1950s were successful and many of her performances were condemned by critics. ''The Hollywood Reporter'' wrote of mannerisms "that you'd expect to find in a nightclub impersonation of [Davis]," while the London critic, Richard Winninger, wrote, "Miss Davis, with more say than most stars as to what films she makes, seems to have lapsed into [[Egotism|egoism]]. The criterion for her choice of film would appear to be that nothing must compete with the full display of each facet of the Davis art. Only bad films are good enough for her."<ref>Carr (1979), p. 193</ref> Her films of this period included ''The Virgin Queen'' (1955), ''Storm Center'' (1956), and ''The Catered Affair'' (1956). As her career declined, her marriage continued to deteriorate until she filed for divorce in 1960. The following year, her mother died. During the same time, she tried television, appearing in three episodes of the popular NBC western ''[[Wagon Train]]'' as three different characters in 1959 and 1961; her first appearance on TV had been 25 February 1956, on ''[[General Electric Theatre]]''.<ref>"Bette Davis Debut," Broadcasting-Telecasting, 2 January 1956, 81. http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1956/1956-01-02-BC.pdf</ref>

In 1960, Davis, a registered [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], appeared at the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]] in Los Angeles, California, where she met future President [[John F. Kennedy]], whom she greatly admired.<ref>carlanthonyonline.com/2012/07/26/ronald-reagan-bette-davis-oppositional-co-stars</ref>

===Renewed success (1961–1970)===
[[File:Bette davis baby jane trailer.jpg|thumb|270px|Davis received her final Academy Award nomination for her role as demented [[Baby Jane Hudson]] in ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962 film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962), opposite [[Joan Crawford]]]]

In 1961 Davis opened in the Broadway production ''[[The Night of the Iguana]]'' to mostly mediocre reviews, and left the production after four months due to "chronic illness." She then joined [[Glenn Ford]] and [[Ann-Margret]] for the [[Frank Capra]] film ''[[A Pocketful of Miracles]]'' (1961) (a remake of Capra's 1933 film, ''[[Lady for a Day]]''), based on a story by [[Damon Runyon]]. She accepted her next role, in the [[Grand Guignol]] [[horror film]] ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962 film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962) after reading the script and believing it could appeal to the same audience that had recently made [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960) a success. She negotiated a deal that would pay her 10&nbsp;percent of the worldwide gross profits, in addition to her salary. The film became one of the year's biggest successes.<ref>Spada (1993), pp. 353–55</ref>

Davis and [[Joan Crawford]] played two aging sisters, former actresses forced by circumstance to share a decaying Hollywood mansion. The director, [[Robert Aldrich]], explained that Davis and Crawford were each aware of how important the film was to their respective careers and commented, "It's proper to say that they really detested each other, but they behaved absolutely perfectly."<ref>Guiles (1995), p. 186</ref> After filming was completed, their public comments against each other allowed the tension to develop into a lifelong feud. When Davis was nominated for an Academy Award, Crawford contacted the other Best Actress nominees (who were unable to attend the ceremonies) and offered to accept the award on their behalf should they win, which was exactly what happened when [[Anne Bancroft]] was announced as winner. Crawford accepted the award on Bancroft's behalf, but not before going near Davis and saying "Excuse me, I have an Oscar to accept". Davis also received her only [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA Award]] nomination for this performance. Daughter Barbara (credited as B. D. Merrill) played a small role in the film and when she and Davis visited the Cannes Film Festival to promote it, she met Jeremy Hyman, an executive for [[Seven Arts Productions]]. After a short courtship, she married Hyman at the age of 16, with Davis' permission.

In early 1963 while [[Raymond Burr]] was recovering from surgery, Davis guest starred in the first of four episodes of ''[[Perry Mason]],'' with Burr doing only cameo roles.  She portrayed a recently widowed attorney who defended Cal Leonard accused of murdering his cousin in "The Case of Constant Doyle." In court she exposed her personal secretary, Miss Givney, played by [[Frances Reid]], as the murderer. Davis portrayed the title character in that episode.

In September 1962, Davis placed an advertisement in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' under the heading of "Situations wanted—women artists," which read, "Mother of three—10, 11 & 15—divorcee. American. Thirty years experience as an actress in Motion Pictures. Mobile still and more affable than rumor would have it. Wants steady employment in Hollywood. (Has had Broadway)."<ref>
{{cite news
| title = Situations wanted—women artists
| work = Variety
| date = 21 September 1962 }}</ref> Davis said that she intended it as a joke, and she sustained her comeback over the course of several years. ''[[Dead Ringer (1964 film)|Dead Ringer]]'' (1964) was a crime drama in which she played twin sisters and ''[[Where Love Has Gone (film)|Where Love Has Gone]]'' (1964) was a romantic drama based on a [[Harold Robbins]] novel. Davis played the mother of [[Susan Hayward]] but filming was hampered by heated arguments between Davis and Hayward.<ref>Spada (1993), p. 376</ref> ''[[Hush… Hush, Sweet Charlotte]]'' (1964) was Robert Aldrich's follow-up to ''What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?,'' in which he planned to reunite Davis and Crawford, but when Crawford withdrew allegedly due to illness soon after filming began, she was replaced by [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film was a considerable success and brought renewed attention to its veteran cast, which also included [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Mary Astor]] and [[Agnes Moorehead]]. The following year, Davis was cast as the lead in an [[Aaron Spelling]] sitcom, ''The Decorator.''<ref>{{cite book |title=Experimental television, test films, pilots, and trial series |last=Terrace |first=Vincent |year=1997 |page=135 |publisher=McFarland |accessdate=2009-08-19 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=r8VkAAAAMAAJ&q|isbn=0-7864-0178-8}}</ref> A [[pilot episode]] was filmed, but was not shown, and the project was terminated. By the end of the decade, Davis had appeared in the British films ''[[The Nanny (1965 film)|The Nanny]]'' (1965), ''[[The Anniversary (1968 film)|The Anniversary]]'' (1968), and ''[[Connecting Rooms]]'' (1970), but her career again stalled.

===Late career (1971–1983)===
[[File:DavisTaylor.jpg|thumb|Davis and [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in late 1981 during a show celebrating Taylor's life]]

In the early 1970s, Davis was invited to appear in New York, in a stage presentation, ''Great Ladies of the American Cinema.'' Over five successive nights, a different female star discussed her career and answered questions from the audience; [[Myrna Loy]], [[Rosalind Russell]], [[Lana Turner]], [[Sylvia Sidney]], and [[Joan Crawford]] were the other participants. Davis was well received and was invited to tour [[Australia]] with the similarly themed, ''Bette Davis in Person and on Film,'' and its success allowed her to take the production to the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>Chandler (2006), pp. 258–59</ref>

In 1972 she played the lead role in two television films that were each intended as [[television pilot|pilots]] for upcoming series for [[NBC]], ''[[Madame Sin]]'' with [[Robert Wagner]], and ''[[The Judge and Jake Wyler]],'' with [[Joan Van Ark]], but in each case, NBC decided against producing a series. She appeared in the stage production, ''Miss Moffat,'' a musical adaptation of her film ''The Corn is Green,'' but after the show was panned by the Philadelphia critics during its pre-Broadway run, she cited a back injury and abandoned the show, which closed immediately. She played supporting roles in ''[[Burnt Offerings (film)|Burnt Offerings]]'' (1976) and ''[[The Disappearance of Aimee]]'' (1976), but clashed with [[Karen Black]] and [[Faye Dunaway]], the stars of the two respective productions, because she felt that neither extended her an appropriate degree of respect, and that their behavior on the film sets was unprofessional.<ref>Spada (1993), pp. 414 (Karen Black), 416 (Faye Dunaway)</ref>

In 1977 Davis became the first woman to receive the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI Life Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]]. The televised event included comments from several of Davis's colleagues including William Wyler who joked that given the chance Davis would still like to refilm a scene from ''The Letter'' to which Davis nodded. [[Jane Fonda]], [[Henry Fonda]], [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Olivia de Havilland]] were among the performers who paid tribute, with de Havilland commenting that Davis "got the roles I always wanted".<ref>Spada (1993), p. 424</ref> Following the telecast she found herself in demand again, often having to choose between several offers. She accepted roles in the television miniseries ''[[The Dark Secret of Harvest Home]]'' (1978) and the theatrical film ''[[Death on the Nile (1978 film)|Death on the Nile]]'' (1978), an [[Agatha Christie]] murder mystery. The bulk of her remaining work was for television. She won an [[Emmy Award]] for ''[[Strangers: The Story of a Mother and Daughter]]'' (1979) with [[Gena Rowlands]], and was nominated for her performances in ''[[White Mama]]'' (1980) and ''[[Little Gloria... Happy at Last]]'' (1982). She also played supporting roles in two [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] films, ''[[Return from Witch Mountain]]'' (1978) and ''[[The Watcher in the Woods]]'' (1980).

Davis' name became well-known to a younger audience when [[Kim Carnes]]' song "[[Bette Davis Eyes]]" (written by [[Jackie DeShannon]]) became a worldwide hit and the best-selling record of 1981 in the U.S., where it stayed at number one on the music charts for more than two months. Davis's grandson was impressed that she was the subject of a hit song and Davis considered it a compliment, writing to both Carnes and the songwriters, and accepting the gift of [[Music recording sales certification|gold and platinum records]] from Carnes, and hanging them on her wall.<ref>Davis (1987), p. 112</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=nmjetV92THsC&pg=PA49&dq=%22This+'N+That%22+%22Bette+Davis+Eyes%22&cd=3#v=onepage&q=%22This%20'N%20That%22%20%22Bette%20Davis%20Eyes%22 |title=The women of Warner Brothers: the ... |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2010-04-14|isbn=978-0-7864-1137-5|year=2002}}</ref> She continued acting for television, appearing in ''[[Family Reunion (film)|Family Reunion]]'' (1981) opposite her grandson J. Ashley Hyman, ''[[A Piano for Mrs. Cimino]]'' (1982) and ''[[Right of Way (film)|Right of Way]]'' (1983) with [[James Stewart]]. In 1983, she was awarded the [[Women in Film Los Angeles|Women in Film]] [[Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards#THE CRYSTAL AWARD|Crystal Award]].<ref name=WIF>{{cite web|title=Past Recipients: Crystal Award|url=http://wif.org/past-recipients|work=Women In Film|accessdate=May 10, 2011}}</ref>

===Illness, conflict and death (1983–1989)===
[[File:BetteDavisTheWhalesofAugust.jpg|thumb|Davis' final completed role in ''[[The Whales of August]]'' (1987) brought her acclaim during a period in which she was beset with failing health and personal trauma.]]

In 1983, after filming the pilot episode for the television series ''[[Hotel (TV series)|Hotel]],'' Davis was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]] and underwent a [[mastectomy]]. Within two weeks of her surgery she suffered four [[stroke]]s which caused [[paralysis]] in the left side of her face and in her left arm, and left her with slurred speech. She commenced a lengthy period of physical therapy and, aided by her personal assistant, Kathryn Sermak, gained partial recovery from the paralysis.

During this time, her relationship with her daughter, [[B. D. Hyman]], deteriorated when Hyman became a [[born again (Christianity)|born-again Christian]] and attempted to persuade Davis to follow suit. With her health stable, she traveled to England to film the [[Agatha Christie]] mystery ''[[Murder with Mirrors]]'' (1985). Upon her return, she learned that Hyman had published a memoir, ''[[My Mother's Keeper]],'' in which she chronicled a difficult mother-daughter relationship and depicted scenes of Davis' overbearing and drunken behavior. Several of Davis' friends commented that Hyman's depictions of events were not accurate; one said, "so much of the book is out of context." [[Mike Wallace (journalist)|Mike Wallace]] rebroadcast a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' interview he had filmed with Hyman a few years earlier in which she commended Davis on her skills as a mother, and said that she had adopted many of Davis' principles in raising her own children. Critics of Hyman noted that Davis had financially supported the Hyman family for several years and had recently saved them from losing their house. Despite the acrimony of their divorce years earlier, Gary Merrill also defended Davis. Interviewed by [[CNN]], Merrill said that Hyman was motivated by "cruelty and greed." Davis' adopted son, Michael Merrill, ended contact with Hyman and refused to speak to her again, as did Davis, who also disinherited her.<ref>Spada (1993), pp. 451–57</ref>

[[File:Ronald Reagan with Bette Davis 1987.jpg|thumb|left|Bette Davis with President [[Ronald Reagan]] (her co-star in 1939's ''[[Dark Victory]]'') in 1987, two years before her death.]]

In her second memoir, ''[[This 'N That]]'' (1987), Davis wrote, "I am still recovering from the fact that a child of mine would write about me behind my back, to say nothing about the kind of book it is. I will never recover as completely from B.D.'s book as I have from the stroke. Both were shattering experiences." Her memoir concluded with a letter to her daughter, in which she addressed her several times as "Hyman," and described her actions as "a glaring lack of loyalty and thanks for the very privileged life I feel you have been given". She concluded with a reference to the title of Hyman's book, "If it refers to money, if my memory serves me right, I've been your keeper all these many years. I am continuing to do so, as my name has made your book about me a success."<ref>Davis (1987), pp. 10, 197–98</ref>

Davis appeared in the television film ''[[As Summers Die]]'' (1986) and [[Lindsay Anderson]]'s film ''[[The Whales of August]]'' (1987), in which she played the blind sister of [[Lillian Gish]]. The film earned good reviews, with one critic writing, "Bette crawls across the screen like a testy old hornet on a windowpane, snarling, staggering, twitching—a symphony of misfired synapses."<ref>Spada (1993), p. 462</ref> Her last performance was the title role in [[Larry Cohen]]'s ''[[Wicked Stepmother]]'' (1989). By this time her health was failing, and after disagreements with Cohen she walked off the set. The script was rewritten to place more emphasis on [[Barbara Carrera]]'s character, and the reworked version was released after Davis' death.

[[File:Bette Davis Tomb.JPG|thumb|Tomb of Bette Davis]]After abandoning ''Wicked Stepmother'' and with no further film offers (though she was keen to play the centenarian in Craig Calman's ''The Turn Of The Century'' and worked with him on adapting the stage play to a feature-length screenplay), Davis appeared on several talk shows and was interviewed by [[Johnny Carson]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Larry King]] and [[David Letterman]], discussing her career but refusing to discuss her daughter. Her appearances were popular; Lindsay Anderson observed that the public enjoyed seeing her behaving "so bitchy." He commented, "I always disliked that because she was encouraged to behave badly. And I'd always hear her described by that awful word, feisty."<ref>Spada (1993), p. 472</ref>

During 1988 and 1989, Davis was fêted for her career achievements, receiving the [[Kennedy Center Honors|Kennedy Center Honor]], the [[Legion of Honor]] from France, the [[Campione d'Italia]] from [[Italy]] and the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Film Society of Lincoln Center Lifetime Achievement Award]]. She collapsed during the American Cinema Awards in 1989 and later discovered that her cancer had returned. She recovered sufficiently to travel to Spain where she was honored at the [[Donostia-San Sebastián International Film Festival]], but during her visit her health rapidly deteriorated. Too weak to make the long journey back to the U.S., she traveled to France where she died on October 6, 1989, at 11:20 pm, at the [[American Hospital of Paris|American Hospital]] in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]]. Davis was 81 years old. She was interred in [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn—Hollywood Hills Cemetery]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], alongside her mother, Ruthie, and sister, Bobby, with her name in larger type size. On her tombstone is written: "She did it the hard way," an [[epitaph]] that she mentioned in her memoir ''Mother Goddam'' as having been suggested to her by Joseph L. Mankiewicz shortly after they had filmed ''All About Eve.''<ref name="goddamprologueIX">Stine (1974), prologue ix</ref>

==Reception and legacy==
As early as 1936, [[Graham Greene]] summed Davis up: "Even the most inconsiderable film ... seemed temporarily better than they were because of that precise, nervy voice, the pale ash-blond hair, the popping, neurotic eyes, a kind of corrupt and phosphorescent prettiness .... I would rather watch Miss Davis than any number of competent pictures."

In 1964 Jack Warner spoke of the "magic quality that transformed this sometimes bland and not beautiful little girl into a great artist,"<ref name="goddamprologueIX" /> and in a 1988 interview, Davis remarked that, unlike many of her contemporaries, she had forged a career without the benefit of beauty.<ref name= MeetingMissDavis>{{cite web |first=Jim |last=Emerson |url =http://www.cinepad.com/bettedavis.htm | title = Meeting Miss Davis | publisher=Jeeem's Cinepad| accessdate = 2008-08-24}}</ref> She admitted she was terrified during the making of her earliest films and that she became tough by necessity. "Until you're known in my profession as a monster, you are not a star," she said, "[but] I've never fought for anything in a treacherous way. I've never fought for anything but the good of the film."<ref name="Movietalk">Shipman (1988), p. 13</ref> During the making of ''All About Eve,'' (1950) Joseph L. Mankiewicz told her of the perception in Hollywood that she was difficult, and she explained that when the audience saw her on screen, they did not consider that her appearance was the result of numerous people working behind the scenes. If she was presented as "a horse's ass ... forty feet wide, and thirty feet high," that is all the audience "would see or care about."<ref>Spada (1993), p. 272</ref>

While lauded for her achievements, Davis and her films were sometimes derided; Pauline Kael described ''Now, Voyager'' (1942) as a "shlock classic,"<ref>Kael (1982), p. 421</ref> and by the mid-1940s her sometimes mannered and histrionic performances had become the subject of caricature. Edwin Schallert for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' praised Davis's performance in ''Mr. Skeffington'' (1944), while observing, "the mimics will have more fun than a box of monkeys imitating Miss Davis," and Dorothy Manners at the ''Los Angeles Examiner'' said of her performance in the poorly received ''Beyond the Forest'' (1949), "no night club caricaturist has ever turned in such a cruel imitation of the Davis mannerisms as Bette turns on herself in this one." ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine noted that Davis was compulsively watchable even while criticizing her acting technique, summarizing her performance in ''Dead Ringer'' (1964) with the observation, "her acting, as always, isn't really acting: it's shameless showing off. But just try to look away!"<ref>Ringgold (1966), p. 178</ref>

She attracted a following in the [[gay subculture]]<ref>{{cite web| title = Queer Icon: The Cult of Bette Davis| url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1381658/| publisher=imdb.com| accessdate = 2009-10-06}}</ref> and was frequently imitated by [[female impersonator]]s such as [[Tracey Lee (female impersonator)|Tracey Lee]] and [[Charles Pierce (female impersonator)|Charles Pierce]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Charles Pierce as Bette Davis| url = http://www.bochynski.com/charlespierce/davis.htm#top| publisher=Bochynski.com| accessdate = 2008-08-24}}</ref> Attempting to explain her popularity with gay audiences, the journalist Jim Emerson wrote, "Was she just a camp figurehead because her brittle, melodramatic style of acting hadn't aged well? Or was it that she was 'Larger Than Life,' a tough broad who had survived? Probably some of both."<ref name= MeetingMissDavis/>

Davis's film choices were often unconventional; she sought roles as manipulators and killers in an era when actresses usually preferred to play sympathetic characters, and she excelled in them. She favored authenticity over glamour and was willing to change her own appearance if it suited the character. [[Claudette Colbert]] commented that Davis was the first actress to play roles older than herself, and therefore did not have to make the difficult transition to character parts as she aged.<ref name="Movietalk" />

As she entered old age, Davis was acknowledged for her achievements. John Springer, who had arranged her speaking tours of the early 1970s, wrote that despite the accomplishments of many of her contemporaries, Davis was "''the'' star of the thirties and into the forties," achieving notability for the variety of her characterizations and her ability to assert herself, even when her material was mediocre.<ref>Springer (1978), p. 81</ref> Individual performances continued to receive praise; in 1987, [[Bill Collins (television presenter)|Bill Collins]] analyzed ''The Letter'' (1940), and described her performance as "a brilliant, subtle achievement," and wrote, "Bette Davis makes Leslie Crosbie one of the most extraordinary females in movies."<ref>Collins (1987), p. 135</ref> In a 2000 review for ''All About Eve,'' (1950) [[Roger Ebert]] noted, "Davis was a character, an icon with a grand style, so even her excesses are realistic."<ref>{{cite web |first=Roger |last=Ebert |url =http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000611/REVIEWS08/6110301/1023 | title = Review of ''All About Eve'' | publisher = RogerEbert.com | date = 2000-06-11 | accessdate = 2008-08-24}}</ref> In 2006, ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'' magazine ranked her portrayal of Margo Channing in the film as fifth on their list of "100 Greatest Performances of All Time," commenting, "There is something deliciously audacious about her gleeful willingness to play such unattractive emotions as jealousy, bitterness, and neediness."<ref>{{cite journal|title=100 Greatest Performances of All Time|journal=''Premiere''|date=April 2006}}</ref> While reviewing ''What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?'' (1962) in 2008, Ebert asserted that "no one who has seen the film will ever forget her."<ref>{{cite web |first=Roger |last=Ebert |url =http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080216/REVIEWS08/14917937/1023| title = What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

A few months before her death in 1989, Davis was one of several actors featured on the cover of ''Life'' magazine. In a film retrospective that celebrated the films and stars of 1939, ''Life'' concluded that Davis was the most significant actress of her era, and highlighted ''Dark Victory'' (1939) as one of the most-important films of the year.<ref name="life">"Hollywood 1939–1989, Today's Stars Meet the Screen Legends." ''[[Life Magazine]]'' Spring 1989.</ref> Her death made front-page news throughout the world as the "close of yet another chapter of the Golden Age of Hollywood." [[Angela Lansbury]] summed up the feeling of those of the Hollywood community who attended her memorial service, commenting after a sample from Davis's films were screened, that they had witnessed "an extraordinary legacy of acting in the twentieth century by a real master of the craft," that should provide "encouragement and illustration to future generations of aspiring actors."<ref>Spada (1993), pp. 480–81</ref>

In 1977 Davis became the first woman to be honored with the [[AFI Life Achievement Award]].<ref>Sikov (2007), p. 405</ref> In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] published its list of the "[[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars]]," which was the result of a film-industry poll to determine the "50 Greatest American Screen Legends" in order to raise public awareness and appreciation of classic film. Of the 25&nbsp;actresses listed, Davis was ranked at number two, behind Katharine Hepburn.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/stars.aspx | title = AFI's 100 Years, 100 Stars, Greatest Film Star Legends |publisher = American Film Institute | accessdate = 2008-08-24| archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20080822055357/http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/stars.aspx| archivedate = August 22, 2008}}</ref>

The First Day of Issue celebration took place September 18, 2008, at Boston University, which houses an extensive Bette Davis archive. Featured speakers included her son Michael Merrill and [[Lauren Bacall]].

In 1997 the executors of her estate, Michael Merrill, her son, and Kathryn Sermak, her former assistant, established "The Bette Davis Foundation" which awards college scholarships to promising actors and actresses.<ref name="BetteDavisofficialsite" />

Davis told [[Johnny Carson]] in a 1983 interview on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' that as an actress, she wanted to be remembered as being a "good worker."

==Academy Awards milestones==
[[File:Bette Davis in Dark Victory trailer.jpg|right|thumb|Davis in the trailer for ''[[Dark Victory]]'' (1939), in which she gave one of her ten Oscar-nominated performances]]

In 1962 Bette Davis became the first person to secure ten Academy Award nominations for acting. Since then only four people have equalled or surpassed this figure, [[Meryl Streep]] (with nineteen nominations and three wins), [[Katharine Hepburn]] (twelve nominations and four wins), [[Jack Nicholson]] (twelve nominations and three wins) and [[Laurence Olivier]] (ten nominations and two wins).<ref>[http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/help/statistics/act5ormore.html ''Persons With 5 or More Acting Nominations."] Academy Awards Database. Oscars.org. Accessed May 24, 2008.</ref>

[[Steven Spielberg]] purchased Davis's Oscars for ''Dangerous'' (1935) and ''Jezebel'' (1938) when they were offered for auction for $207,500 and $578,000, respectively, and returned them to the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]].<ref>[http://www.reelclassics.com/Scrapbook/dangerous-scrapbook.htm "Classic Movie Scrapbook: Dangerous."] Reel Classics.com.

* 1934: Davis's performance in ''[[Of Human Bondage (1934 film)|Of Human Bondage]]'' (1934) was widely acclaimed and when she was not nominated for an Academy Award, several influential people mounted a campaign to have her name included. The Academy relaxed its rules for that year (and the following year also) to allow for the consideration of any performer nominated in a write-in vote; therefore, any performance of the year was technically eligible for consideration. Given the well-publicized hoopla, some sources still consider this as a nomination for Davis; however, the Academy does not officially record this as a nomination.<ref name="Wiley" />
