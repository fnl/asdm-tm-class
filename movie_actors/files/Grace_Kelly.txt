'''Grace Patricia Kelly''' (November 12, 1929{{spaced ndash}}September 14, 1982) was an American actress who, after marrying [[Rainier III, Prince of Monaco|Prince Rainier III]], became the [[List of Monegasque consorts|Princess of Monaco]].

After embarking on an acting career in 1950, at the age of 20, Kelly appeared in [[New York City]] theatrical productions and more than 40 episodes of live drama productions broadcast during the early 1950s [[Golden Age of Television]]. In October 1953, she gained stardom from her performance in the film ''[[Mogambo]]''. It won her a [[Golden Globe Award]] and an [[Academy Award]] nomination in 1954. She had leading roles in five films, including ''[[The Country Girl (1954 film)|The Country Girl]]'', for which her deglamorized performance earned her an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1954 Academy Awards: Winners and History|url=http://www.filmsite.org/aa54.html|website=AMC Filmsite}}</ref> Other films include ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952) with [[Gary Cooper]], ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'' (1954) with [[Ray Milland]], ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954) with [[James Stewart]] and ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955) with [[Cary Grant]], and ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'' (1956) with [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Bing Crosby]]. 

Kelly retired from acting at the age of 26 to marry Rainier and began her duties in [[Monaco]]. They had three children: [[Caroline, Princess of Hanover|Caroline]], [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco|Albert]], and [[Princess Stéphanie of Monaco|Stéphanie]]. She retained her American roots, maintaining dual U.S. and Monégasque citizenship.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Buchwald|first1=Art|title=Grace Kelly Can Retain American Citizenship: Status of Pat Poodle Oliver Not So Clear; His Marriage Could Start Monaco Squabble|url=http://search.proquest.com.proxy.library.cornell.edu/docview/166920188?pq-origsite=summon|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=April 17, 1956}}</ref> She died on September 14, 1982, a day after a stroke caused her to crash her car.

==Early years==

===Family===
Kelly was born on November 12, 1929 in [[Philadelphia]], to an affluent family. Her paternal grandparents were Irish and her maternal grandparents were German.<ref>http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/features/2010/05/grace-kelly-201005</ref> Her father, [[John B. Kelly, Sr.]], won three Olympic gold medals for [[Sport rowing|sculling]]. He later founded a brickwork contracting company that became well known on the East Coast. He registered as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], and was then nominated to be [[List of mayors of Philadelphia|mayor]] for the 1935 election, but lost by the closest margin in the city's history. In later years, he served on the [[Fairmount Park]] Commission and, during World War II, was appointed by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] as National Director of Physical Fitness. Her mother, [[Margaret Katherine Majer]], taught physical education at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. Margaret was the first female to coach women's athletics teams at the institution, and was also a beauty queen and model; in her later years, she suffered from a stroke and was admitted to a convalescent home, where she eventually died of pneumonia at the age of 91.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kaplan|first1=Tracey|title=Margaret Kelly, 91; Princess Grace's Mother, Head of Influential Family|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-08/news/mn-107_1_margaret-kelly|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=January 8, 1990}}</ref>

Grace had two older siblings, Margaret (June 13, 1925&nbsp;– November 23, 1991) and [[John B. Kelly, Jr.|John Jr.]] (May 24, 1927&nbsp;– March 2, 1985), and a younger sister named Elizabeth (June 25, 1933&nbsp;– November 24, 2009). They were raised Catholic.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/5514352/High-Society-Grace-Kelly-and-Hollywood-by-Donald-Spoto-review.html|title=Grace Kelly and Hollywood by Donald Spoto|work=The Times |location=UK |first=Donald|last=Spoto|date=May 28, 2009|quote = Born in 1929 and raised by stiff-necked Catholic parents in Philadelphia&nbsp;… Philadelphia convent girl (always remaining Roman Catholic&nbsp;… |accessdate=May 20, 2010|first2=Barry|last2=Forshaw}}</ref><ref name="jacobs201005">{{cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/features/2010/05/grace-kelly-201005|title=Grace Kelly's Forever Look|work=Vanity Fair |date=May 2010|accessdate=December 30, 2010|first=Laura|last=Jacobs}}</ref>

Margaret, more commonly known as Peggy, lived to be 65. At her baptism in 1925, John Kelly's mother, Mary Costello Kelly, expressed her disappointment that the baby was not named Grace in memory of her last daughter, who had died young. Upon Mary's death the following year, John resolved that his next daughter would bear the name and, three years later, with the arrival of Grace Patricia in November 1929, Mary's wish was honored.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

John Jr. won the [[James E. Sullivan Award]] as the country's top amateur athlete for rowing in 1947. He followed in his father's footsteps and competed at the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]], [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952]], [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]], and [[1960 Summer Olympics]]. During the 1956 Summer Olympics in [[Melbourne]], he won a bronze medal, which he gave to Grace as a late wedding gift. In addition to his rowing career, he also served as a city councillor. Philadelphia's Kelly Drive is named in his honor.

Two of Kelly's uncles were prominent in the arts. John's eldest brother, [[Walter C. Kelly]] (1873–1939), was a [[vaudeville]] star. His nationally-known act ''The Virginia Judge'' was filmed as a 1930 [[MGM]] short and a 1935 [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] feature. Another uncle, [[George Kelly (playwright)|George Kelly]] (1887–1974), was estranged from the family due to his homosexuality. He became renowned in the 1920s as a dramatist, screenwriter and director, with a hit comedy-drama, ''[[The Show Off]]'', in 1924–25, and he was awarded the 1926 [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] for his next play, ''[[Craig's Wife]]''.<ref name="leigh">{{harvnb|Leigh|2007}}</ref>

===Education===
While attending [[Ravenhill Academy]], a prestigious Catholic girls' school, Kelly modeled fashions at local social events with her mother and sisters. In 1942, at the age of twelve, she played the lead in ''Don't Feed the Animals'', a play produced by the East Falls Old Academy Players.<ref name="leigh" /> Before graduating in May 1947 from Stevens School, a socially prominent private institution on Walnut Lane in the [[Northwest Philadelphia]] neighborhood of [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown]], she acted and danced. Her graduation yearbook listed her favorite actress as [[Ingrid Bergman]] and her favorite actor as [[Joseph Cotten]].<ref>{{cite book| last = Spoto| first = Donald| title = High Society: The Life of Grace Kelly| publisher=Harmony| year = 2009| day =| isbn= 0-307-39561-8| page= 22}}</ref> Written in the "Stevens' Prophecy" section was: "Miss Grace P. Kelly – a famous star of stage and screen."
Owing to her low mathematics scores, Kelly was rejected by [[Bennington College]] in July 1947.<ref>{{harvnb|Leigh|2007|p=26}}</ref>

===Early years===

Despite her parents' disapproval, Kelly decided to pursue her dreams of being an actress. John was particularly displeased with her decision; he viewed acting as "a slim cut above streetwalker."{{r|jacobs201005}}

To start her career, she tried to get admitted into the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]] in New York. In her audition, she used a scene from her Uncle George's 1923 play ''The Torch-Bearers''. Although the school had already met its semester quota, she obtained an interview with the admission officer, Emile Diestel, and was admitted through the influence of George.{{r|jacobs201005}}. She began her first term the following October. While at school, she lived in Manhattan's [[Barbizon Hotel for Women]], a prestigious establishment which barred men from entering after 10&nbsp;pm, and she worked as a model to support her studies.

Kelly worked diligently and practiced her speech by using a tape recorder. Her early acting pursuits led her to the stage, most notably a Broadway debut in [[August Strindberg|Strindberg]]'s ''[[The Father (Strindberg)|The Father]]'' alongside [[Raymond Massey]]. At 19, her graduation performance was as Tracy Lord in ''[[The Philadelphia Story (play)|The Philadelphia Story]]''.{{r|jacobs201005}}

Television producer [[Delbert Mann]] cast Kelly as Bethel Merriday, in an adaptation of the [[Sinclair Lewis]] novel of the same name; this was her first of nearly sixty live television programs.{{r|jacobs201005}} Success on television eventually brought her a role in a major motion picture. She made her film debut in a small role in the 1951 film ''[[Fourteen Hours]]''. She was noticed during a visit to the set by [[Gary Cooper]], who subsequently starred with her in ''[[High Noon]]''. He was charmed by her and said that she was "different from all these actresses we've been seeing so much of."

However, Kelly's performance in ''Fourteen Hours'' was not noticed by critics and did not lead to her receiving other film acting roles. She continued her work in the theater and on television,<ref name="leigh" /> although she lacked "vocal horsepower" and would likely not have had a lengthy stage career.{{r|jacobs201005}} She had various roles on television shows produced by NBC and CBS. She was performing in Denver's [[Elitch Theatre|Elitch Gardens]] when she received a telegram from Hollywood producer [[Stanley Kramer]] offering her a co-starring role opposite [[Gary Cooper]] in ''[[High Noon]]''.

===Acting career for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===
[[File:Mogambo2.jpg|thumb|With [[Clark Gable]] in ''[[Mogambo]]'', 1953]]
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2014}}
Director [[John Ford]] had first noticed Kelly in a 1950 screen test. The studio flew her to Los Angeles to audition in September 1952, and he said that she showed "breeding, quality and class."{{r|jacobs201005}} She was hired for the role and was offered a seven-year contract with a salary of $850 a week. She signed the deal under two conditions: That every two years she could get time off to do theater performances, and that she could live in New York City at the now-landmarked Manhattan House (200 E. 66th Street).<ref>{{cite news|last=Barbanel |first=Josh |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/realestate/28deal1.html|title=The Kelly Connection|location=New York City|newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 28, 2007 |accessdate=June 19, 2011}}</ref>{{r|jacobs201005}}

Two months after signing her contract, Kelly and the cast arrived in [[Nairobi]] to begin production of the film ''Mogambo''. [[Gene Tierney]] was initially cast in the role, but she had to drop out at the last minute due to personal issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen.com/show/267/Gene+Tierney/index.html |title=The Private Life and Times of Gene Tierney |publisher=Glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen.com |accessdate=March 13, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first1=Gene|last1=Tierney|first2=Mickey|last2=Herskowitz|date=1978|publisher=Wyden Books|title=Self-Portrait|pages=150–151|oclc= 5016010}}</ref> Upon getting the role, she told Hollywood columnist [[Hedda Hopper]], "''Mogambo'' had three things that interested me. John Ford, [[Clark Gable]], and a trip to Africa with expenses paid. If ''Mogambo'' had been made in Arizona, I wouldn't have done it."<ref name="Hedda Hopper Collection">{{cite book |title= Hedda Hopper Collection|publisher=Maraget Herrick Library, Los Angeles}}</ref> A break in the filming schedule afforded her and ''Mogambo'' costar [[Ava Gardner]] a visit to Rome.<ref>{{cite book |last= Kaplan |first= James |title= Frank: The Voice|publisher=Doubleday|year= 2010 |isbn= 0-385-51804-8 |page= 586}}</ref> Her role as Linda Nordley in MGM's production of ''[[Mogambo]]'' garnered her a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture|Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress]] and her first [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]].

[[File:Dial M for Murder1.jpg|thumb|''[[Dial M for Murder]]'', 1954]]
After the success of ''Mogambo'', Kelly starred in a TV play ''The Way of an Eagle'' with [[Jean-Pierre Aumont]], before being cast in the film adaptation of [[Frederick Knott]]'s Broadway hit ''[[Dial M for Murder]]''. Director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] also saw the 1950 screen test{{r|jacobs201005}} and took full advantage of her beauty on-camera. He was one of her last mentors in the film industry.

Kelly began filming scenes for her next film ''[[The Bridges at Toko-Ri]]'' in January 1954 with [[William Holden]]. She played Nancy, the wife of naval officer Harry (Holden), who was a minor but pivotal character in the story. A film review that was released 12 months later, the ''[[The New Yorker]]'' remarked on the apparent on-screen chemistry between them, and took note of her delivery of her performance "with quiet confidence."

Kelly unhesitatingly turned down the opportunity to star alongside [[Marlon Brando]] in ''[[On the Waterfront]]''.{{cn|date=October 2014}} [[Eva Marie Saint]], who replaced her, won an Academy Award for that role. Kelly committed to the role of Lisa Fremont in ''[[Rear Window]]'' instead. Said Kelly, "All through the making of ''Dial M for Murder'', he (Hitchcock) sat and talked to me about ''Rear Window'' all the time, even before we had discussed my being in it."<ref>{{cite book |last= Spoto |first= Donald |title= The Dark Side of Genius: The Life of Alfred Hitchcock|publisher=Boston: Little, Brown|year= 1983 |isbn= 0-306-80932-X}}</ref> During the shooting of ''Dial M for Murder'', they shared a close bond of humor and admiration, although minor strife sometimes emerged on set.

[[File:Rearwindow trailer 2.jpg|thumb|left|With [[James Stewart]] in ''[[Rear Window]]'', 1954]]
Kelly's new costar, [[James Stewart]], was highly enthusiastic about working with her.<ref>{{cite book |last= Eyles |first= Allen |title= James Stewart|publisher=Stein & Day|date=September 1987 |isbn= 0-8128-8298-9}}</ref> The role of Lisa Fremont, a wealthy Manhattan socialite and model, was unlike any of the previous women she had played. For the very first time, she portrayed an independent, career-driven woman. He played a speculative photographer with a broken leg, bound to a wheelchair, and so reduced to curiously observing the happenings outside his window. Just as he had done earlier, Hitchcock provided the camera with a slow-sequenced silhouette of her, along with a close-up of the two stars kissing, and finally lingering closely on her profile. With the film's opening in October 1954, she was praised again. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'''s film critic remarked on the casting, commenting on the "earthy quality to the relationship between Stewart and Miss Kelly. Both do a fine job of the picture's acting demands."<ref>{{cite news|first=William|last=Brogdon|date=July 14, 1954|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117794347.html?categoryid=31&cs=1|title=Rear Window|work=Variety |accessdate=June 17, 2009}}</ref>

Kelly won the role of [[Bing Crosby]]'s long-suffering wife, Georgie Elgin, in ''[[The Country Girl (1954 film)|The Country Girl]]'', after a pregnant [[Jennifer Jones]] bowed out. Already familiar with the play, she was highly interested in the part. To do so, MGM would have to lend her out to [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]. She was adamant, and threatened the studio that if they did not allow her to do it she would pack her bags and leave for New York for good. They relented, and the part was hers. The film also paired her again with William Holden. The wife of a washed-up alcoholic singer, played by Crosby, her character is emotionally torn between two lovers.

For her performance in ''The Country Girl'', Kelly was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. Her main competitor for the prize was [[Judy Garland]], in her much heralded comeback performance in ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]'', playing not only the part of an up-and-coming actress-singer, but also, ironically, the wife of an alcoholic movie star. Although she won the [[New York Film Critics Circle]] Award for best actress for her performances in her three big movie roles of 1954, ''Rear Window'', ''Dial M For Murder'', and ''The Country Girl'', she and Garland both received [[Golden Globe Awards]] for their respective performances.

[[File:To Catch a Thief3.jpg|thumb|left|With [[Cary Grant]] in ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'', 1955]]

By the following March, the race between Kelly and Garland for the Oscar was very close. On March 30, 1955, the night of the Academy Awards telecast, Garland was unable to attend because she was in the hospital having just given birth to her son, Joey Luft. However, she was rumored to be the odds-on favorite, and NBC Television cameras were set up in her hospital room so that if she was announced as the winner, she could make her acceptance speech live from her hospital bed. However, when William Holden announced Kelly as the winner, the technicians immediately dismantled the cameras without saying one word to Garland.

In April 1954, Kelly flew to [[Colombia]] for a ten-day shoot on her next project, ''[[Green Fire]]'', with [[Stewart Granger]]. She played Catherine Knowland, a coffee plantation owner. In Granger's autobiography he writes of his distaste for the film's script, while she later confided to [[Hedda Hopper]], "It wasn't pleasant. We worked at a pathetic village – miserable huts and dirty. Part of the crew got shipwrecked&nbsp;… It was awful."<ref name="Hedda Hopper Collection"/> ''Green Fire'' was a critical and box-office failure but made a small profit of $840,000.

After the consecutive filming of ''Rear Window'', ''Toko-Ri'', ''Country Girl'', and ''Green Fire'', Kelly flew to France, along with department store heir Bernard "Barney" Strauss, to begin work on her third and last film for Alfred Hitchcock, ''[[To Catch a Thief]]''. She and her costar, [[Cary Grant]], developed a mutual admiration. They cherished their time together for the rest of their lives. Years later, when asked to name his all-time favorite actress, he replied without hesitation, "Well, with all due respect to dear [[Ingrid Bergman]], I much preferred Grace. She had serenity."<ref>{{cite book |last= Nelson |first= Nancy|title= Evenings With Cary Grant|publisher=Citadel|date=December 2002 |isbn= 0-8065-2412-X}}</ref>

==Philanthropy==
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2014}}
After her marriage to Prince Rainier, Kelly became involved with philanthropic work since she was no longer allowed to act.

Kelly founded [[The World Association of Children's Friends|AMADE Mondiale]], a Monaco-based non-profit organization that was eventually recognized by the [[United Nations|UN]] as a [[Non-governmental organization|Non-Governmental organization]]. According to [[UNESCO]]'s website, AMADE promotes and protects the "moral and physical integrity" and "spiritual well-being of children throughout the world, without distinction of race, nationality or religion and in a spirit of complete political independence." Her daughter, Princess Caroline, carries the torch for AMADE today in her role as President.

Kelly was also active in improving the arts institutions of Monaco, forming the Princess Grace Foundation in 1964 to support local [[artisan]]s. In 1983, following her death, Princess Caroline assumed the duties of President of the Board of Trustees of the Foundation. Prince Albert is Vice-President.<ref>[http://www.palais.mc/wwwpal.nsf/c3241c4782f528bdc1256d52004f970b/8a1843f4fb454d97c1256ba60045b973?OpenDocument Princess Grace Foundation]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref>

The Princess Grace Foundation-USA (PGF-USA) was established following the death of Kelly to continue the work that she had done, anonymously, during her lifetime, assisting emerging theater, dance and film artists in America. Incorporated in 1982, PGF-USA is headquartered in New York and is a tax-exempt, not-for-profit, publicly supported organization. The Princess Grace Awards, a program of the Princess Grace Foundation-USA, has awarded nearly 500 artists at more than 100 institutions in the U.S. with more than $7 million to date. The foundation also says it "holds the exclusive rights and facilitates the licensing of her name and likeness throughout the world."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pgfusa.org/licensing | title=Licensing | publisher=Princess Grace Foundation-USA |accessdate=May 14, 2014 }}</ref>

In addition, Kelly was one of the first celebrities to support and speak on behalf of [[La Leche League]], an organization that advocates breastfeeding. She also planned a yearly Christmas party for local orphans and dedicated a Garden Club.

==Personal life==

===Relationship with Rainier III===
Kelly headed the U.S. delegation at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in April 1955. While there, she was invited to participate in a photo session at the [[Prince's Palace of Monaco|Palace of Monaco]] with [[Rainier III, Prince of Monaco|Prince Rainier III]], the sovereign of the principality. After a series of delays and complications, she met him in Monaco. At the time of her initial meeting with him, she was dating the French actor [[Jean-Pierre Aumont]].<ref>{{cite book|first=H. Kristina|last=Haugland|title=Grace Kelly: Icon of Style to Royal Bride|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JE5ITOBYBJUC&pg=PA966|accessdate=January 5, 2013|year=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-11644-1|pages=966–}}</ref><ref name="Inc1955">{{cite journal|journal=LIFE|title=Grace's Riviera Romance|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kFYEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA15|accessdate=January 5, 2013|date=May 30, 1955|publisher=Time Inc|pages=14–15|issn=00243019}}</ref>

Upon returning to America, Kelly began work on ''[[The Swan (film)|The Swan]]'', in which she coincidentally portrayed a princess, and she meanwhile began a private correspondence with Rainier.

In December 1955, Rainier went to America on a trip officially designated as a tour, although it was speculated that he was actively seeking a wife. A treaty with France in 1918 had stated that if he did not produce an heir, Monaco would revert to France; this was as a result of the [[Monaco Succession Crisis of 1918]]. At a press conference in the U.S., he was asked if he was pursuing a wife, to which he answered, "No." Then a second question was posed: "If you ''were'' pursuing a wife, what kind would you like?" Rainier smiled and answered, "I don't know – the best."

That same year MGM released Kelly's last film, the musical comedy ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'', which was based on the studio's 1940 comedy ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]''. She wore her own engagement ring in the film and one of its highlights was her duet with Bing Crosby, "True Love," a song with words and music by [[Cole Porter]].

===Wedding and marriage===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2013}}
Rainier met Kelly and her family, and after three days, he proposed. She accepted and the families began preparations for what the press dubbed "The Wedding of the Century." She and her family had to provide a [[dowry]] of $2 million in order for the marriage to go forward.<ref>{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2003|p=96}}</ref>

The religious wedding was set for April 19, 1956. News of the engagement was a sensation, even though it meant a probable end to Kelly's film career. Alfred Hitchcock quipped that he was "very happy that Grace has found herself such a good part."
[[File:High Society4.jpg|thumb|left|With [[Frank Sinatra]] in ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'', 1956]] 
Preparations were elaborate. The Palace of Monaco was painted and redecorated throughout. On April 4, 1956,  Grace, with her family, bridesmaids, poodle, and over eighty pieces of luggage boarded the ocean liner [[SS Constitution|SS ''Constitution'']] for the [[French Riviera]]. Some 400 reporters applied to sail, although most were turned away. Thousands of fans sent the party off for the eight-day voyage.  More than 20,000 people lined the streets of Monaco to greet the future [[princess consort]].

===Later years===
[[File:Gracia van Monaco (1972).jpg|thumb|Grace of Monaco (1972)]]
Hitchcock offered Kelly the lead in his film ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' in 1962. She was eager, but public outcry in Monaco against her involvement in a film that portrayed her as a kleptomaniac made her reconsider and ultimately reject the project. Director Herbert Ross attempted to lure her into accepting a part in his 1977 film ''[[The Turning Point (1977 film)|The Turning Point]]'', but Rainier quashed the idea.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} Later that year, she returned to the arts in a series of poetry readings on stage and narration of the documentary ''The Children of Theater Street''. She also narrated [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] made-for-television film ''[[The Poppy Is Also a Flower]]'' (1966).

===Death===
On September 13, 1982, Kelly was driving back to [[Monaco]] from her country home in [[Mont Agel|Roc Agel]] when she had a [[stroke]]. As a result, she lost control of her 1971 [[Rover P6|Rover P6 3500]]<ref>References:

Doctors tried to stop her internal bleeding during surgery and performed CAT scans to diagnose her brain damage.

Stephanie's original diagnosis was mild, with only minor bruising and a light concussion. However, after receiving x-ray results, she was found to have suffered a hairline [[fracture]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/14/newsid_2516000/2516601.stm |title=BBC On This Day September 14th 1982 |publisher=BBC News |date=September 14, 1985 |accessdate=March 13, 2010}}</ref> on the seventh cervical vertebra.

====Funeral====
Kelly's funeral was held at the [[Saint Nicholas Cathedral, Monaco]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcouncil.org/learnenglish-central-history-princess-grace.htm |title=Death of Princess Grace – history – central |publisher=British Council |accessdate=March 13, 2010}}{{dead link|date=September 2014}}</ref> on September 18, 1982. After a Requiem Mass, she was buried in the Grimaldi family vault. Over 400 guests attended, including First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]], [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]], and [[Cary Grant]]. At a later memorial service in Beverly Hills,  [[James Stewart]] delivered the following eulogy:

{{bquote|You know, I just love Grace Kelly. Not because she was a princess, not because she was an actress, not because she was my friend, but because she was just about the nicest lady I ever met. Grace brought into my life as she brought into yours, a soft, warm light every time I saw her, and every time I saw her was a holiday of its own. No question, I'll miss her, we'll all miss her, God bless you, Princess Grace.}}

Rainier, who never remarried, was buried alongside her following his death in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gouv.mc/devwww/wwwnew.nsf/1909$/b1c5425907fc1876c125706d0042ab74gb?OpenDocument&2Gb|title=Monaco Cathedral|date=July 28, 2008|publisher=Service Informatique du Ministère d'Etat (Monaco Minister of State Information Service|accessdate=October 16, 2010}}</ref>

==Legacy==

===Fashion===
While pregnant with her daughter Caroline in 1956, Kelly was frequently photographed clutching a distinctive leather hand-bag manufactured by [[Hermès]]. The purse, or [[Sac à dépêches]], was likely a shield to prevent her pregnant abdomen from being exposed to the prying eyes of the paparazzi. The photographs, however, popularized the purse and became so closely associated with the fashion icon that it would thereafter be known as the [[Kelly Bag]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pursuitist.com/style/hermes-kelly-bag/ |title=History of the Hermes Kelly Bag |publisher=pursuitist.com |date=August 13, 2011 |accessdate=August 13, 2011}}</ref>

Kelly was inaugurated into the [[International Best Dressed List]] Hall of Fame in 1960.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2012/07/best-dressed-hall-of-fame-reminder |title=The International Best-Dressed List Hall of Fame|website=Vanity Fair |date=June 7, 2012 |accessdate=September 6, 2014}}</ref>

After her death, Kelly's legacy as a fashion icon lived on. Modern designers, such as Tommy Hilfiger and Zac Posen, have cited her as a fashion inspiration.<ref name="jacobs201005" /> During her lifetime, she was known for introducing the "fresh faced" look, one that involved bright skin and natural beauty with little makeup.<ref name="Grace Kelly is 1955 Beauty Ideal">{{cite web|last1=Dahl|first1=Arlene|title=Grace Kelly is 1955 Beauty Ideal|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/179677900?pq-origsite=summon|website=www.proquest.com|publisher=Chicago Daily Tribune|accessdate=2014-09-25}}</ref> Her fashion legacy was even commemorated at the Victoria and Albert Museum of London, where an exhibit titled, "Grace Kelly: Style Icon" paid tribute to her impact on the world of fashion.<ref name="jacobs201005" /> The exhibit included 50 of her legendary ensembles.<ref name="No Wonder They Called Her Grace"/> She is remembered for her "college-girl" everyday fashion, defined by her pulled-together yet simple look.<ref name="No Wonder They Called Her Grace"/>

In 2003, the [[Henley Royal Regatta]] renamed the Women's Quadruple Sculls the "[[Princess Grace Challenge Cup]]."
