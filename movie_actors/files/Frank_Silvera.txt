In 1952, Silvera made his film debut in the western, ''[[The Cimarron Kid]]''. Because of his strongly Spanish appearance, he was cast in a variety of ethnic roles in films and television.<ref name="berry"/> He was cast as [[Victoriano Huerta|General Huerta]] in ''[[Viva Zapata!]]'', which starred [[Marlon Brando]]. Ironically, it was the first time a major motion picture studio had used a non-white actor to play a non-white character.

In 1963, Silvera was nominated for a [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play]] for playing Monsieur Duval in ''[[The Lady of the Camellias]]''. 

In 1964, Silvera and [[Vantile Whitfield]] founded The Theatre of Being, a Los Angeles-based theater dedicated to providing black actors with non-stereotypical roles. One of their first projects was producing ''[[The Amen Corner]]'' by African-American writer [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]]. Silvera and Whitfield financed the play themselves and with donations from friends. It opened on March 4, 1964 and would gross $200,000 within the year, moving to Broadway in April 1965. [[Beah Richards]] won critical acclaim for her performance as the lead.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=idBTAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xDgNAAAAIBAJ&pg=740,1497104&dq=frank+silvera+the+theatre+of+being&hl=en|title='Civil Rights' Theater Has New Show on Broadway|date=May 9, 1965|work=St. Joseph News-Press|page=5D|accessdate=January 8, 2013}}</ref>

He appeared as a Mexican bandit in the 1967 [[Martin Ritt]]-directed Western classic, ''[[Hombre (film)|Hombre]]'', based on the [[Hombre (novel)|Elmore Leonard novel]]. In 1969, Silvera had a supporting role as Goatherd in ''[[Che!]]'', and as Lobero in the [[Zapata Western]] ''[[Guns of the Magnificent Seven]]''. {{cn|date=December 2013}}

Silvera was then hired as the first [[Artist-in-residence|guest director]] at [[California State University, Fresno|Fresno State College (FSC)]], with plans to stage a production of ''The Tea Concession'' by [[Henry Kemp-Blair|Henry J. Kemp-Blair]], which reversed the racial positions of black and white in a drama about [[South Africa]].<ref name="Fresno1-Silvera">{{cite news|title='Chapparral' Actor Dies in LA Area|url=http://www.ancestry.com|newspaper=[[The Fresno Bee]]|location=Fresno, California|date=1970-06-11|page=6-D|accessdate=2013-08-16|quote=Frank Silvera, 56, the veteran character actor who spent a week at Fresno State College last fall in an aborted post as artist-in-residence, died earlier today in his home in Pasadena.}}</ref> However, he was forced to resign less than two weeks later, caught in the middle of administrative shakeups and the aborted hiring of [[Marvin X]] by the Black Studies department. "With this upheaval it seemed to blacks and browns that Silvera was part of the package, part of the hardline takeover (at FSC). There was such a sense of despair and betrayal...they took it out on me," Silvera said to David Hale, theater writer for [[The Fresno Bee]]. "It seemed to me they thought I was the agent to smooth things over while the establishment hatched up something else dirty."<ref name="Fresno2-Silvera">{{cite news|title=Frank Silvera ...

Frank Silvera died in an accident at home in 1970.

His final film, ''[[Valdez Is Coming]]'', was released posthumously, in 1971.

In 2005, the workshop was among 406 [[New York City]] arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the [[Carnegie Corporation]], which was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor, [[Michael Bloomberg]].<ref name="NYT">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/06/nyregion/06donate.html?_r=1&ex=1278302400&en=93a1beabd4ede5b8&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss|title=City Groups Get Bloomberg Gift of $20 Million|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2011-02-25|first=Sam|last=Roberts|date=July 6, 2005}}</ref>
