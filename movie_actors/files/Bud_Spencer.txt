'''Bud Spencer''' (born '''Carlo Pedersoli'''; 31 October 1929) is an Italian actor, filmmaker and a former professional swimmer. He is known for past roles in [[action-comedy]] films together with his long-time film partner [[Terence Hill]]. Growing from a successful swimmer in his youth, he got a degree in law, and has registered several patents. Spencer also became a certified commercial airline and helicopter pilot, and supports and funds many children's charities, including the Spencer Scholarship Fund.<ref name=imdb>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0817881/bio Bud Spencer on imdb.com]</ref>

Bud Spencer and Terence Hill both appeared in, produced and directed over 20 films together and thus became and still remain best friends to this present day.

In a recent interview, Spencer commented: "Terence is like a brother to me, and like brothers we don't always agree, and he can be a pain in the neck sometimes." [laughs] "...&nbsp;our relationship I suppose is reflected in our movies, but he can always count on me as I can on him. We always enjoyed working together, probably why we made so many films together."

==Biography==
Spencer was born in [[Borgo Santa Lucia|Santa Lucia]], a historical [[rione]] of the city of [[Naples]].

From 1947 to 1949 he worked in the Italian consulate in [[Recife]] (Brazil),<ref>[http://acervo.revistabula.com/posts/colunistas/meu-encontro-com-bud-spencer Meu encontro com Bud Spencer] (in Portuguese)</ref> where he learned fluent Portuguese. He changed his screen name in 1967, reportedly choosing to pay homage to [[Spencer Tracy]] as well as his favorite beer, [[Budweiser Budvar Brewery|Budweiser]]. Other sources report that he found it funny to call himself "bud" despite his weight and his imposing height at almost {{convert|6|ft|4|in|cm|abbr=on}}.<ref name=imdb/>

===Swimming and water polo career===
A professional swimmer in his youth, Spencer was the first Italian to swim the 100 m [[Freestyle swimming|freestyle]] in less than one minute. He achieved this on 19 September 1950, when he swam the 100 m in 59.5 s.<ref name="AgendaDiana Salsomaggiore">[http://www.agendadiana.com/visualizza_gara.php?id_gara=5789 Italian swimming records]</ref>

In the [[1951 Mediterranean Games]], he won a silver medal in the same 100 m freestyle event.<ref>[http://www.agendadiana.com/visualizza_gara.php?id_gara=8211 Mediterranean Games, 1951]</ref>

Spencer participated in the [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Olympic Games]] in Helsinki, Finland, reaching the semi-finals in the 100 m freestyle (58.8 s heats, 58.9 s semi final).<ref name="Helsinki 1952">[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1952/OR1952.pdf Helsinki 1952 official report]</ref> [[1956 Summer Olympics|Four years later]], in Melbourne, he also entered the semi-finals in the same category (58.5 s heat, 59.0 s semi final).<ref name="Melbourne 1956">[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1956/OR1956.pdf Melbourne 1956 official report]</ref>

As a water polo player, he won the Italian Championship in 1954, with [[S.S. Lazio]]. His swimming career ended abruptly in 1957.

On 17 January 2005 he was awarded with the ''Caimano d'oro'' (Gold Caiman) by the [[Italian Swimming Federation]].<ref name="Pedersoli award">[http://www.federnuoto.it/federazione.asp?p=articolo&id=5758 Pedersoli receives the Gold Caiman {{it icon}}]</ref>

On 24 January 2007, he received from the Italian Swimming Federation's president [[Paolo Barelli]], swim and water polo coach diplomas.<ref name="Pedersoli diploma">[http://www.federnuoto.it/federazione.asp?p=articolo&id=11340 Pedersoli receives two coach diplomas {{it icon}}]</ref>

===Acting career===
Spencer's first movie role was in ''[[Quel fantasma di mio marito]]'', an Italian comedy shot in 1949 and released in 1950. Then he played a member of the [[Praetorian Guard]] in ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'', a film shot in Italy, in 1951.<ref name=imdb/> During the 1950s and part of the 1960s, Spencer appeared in some Italian films but "his career was strictly minor league until the late 1960s."<ref name=imdb/>

Spencer met his future film partner, [[Terence Hill]], on the set of ''[[Annibale (film)|Hannibal]]'' in 1959. They went on to work together on over 20 films, including (named using their most common US titles):
#''[[Annibale (film)|Hannibal]]'' (1959), as ''Carlo Pedersoli'' together with ''[[Mario Girotti]]''
#''[[God Forgives... I Don't!]]'' (1967), first time as ''Bud Spencer'' together with ''Terence Hill''
#''[[Ace High (1968 film)|Ace High]]'' (1968)
#''[[Boot Hill (film)|Boot Hill]]'' (1969)
#''[[They Call Me Trinity]]'' (1970)
#''[[Blackie the Pirate]]'' (1971)
#''[[Trinity Is Still My Name]]'' (1971)
#''[[All the Way, Boys]]'' (1972)
#''[[Watch Out, We're Mad]]'' (1974)

#''[[Io sto con gli ippopotami|I'm For the Hippopotamus]]'' (1979)
#''[[Who Finds a Friend Finds a Treasure]]'' (1981)
#''[[Go for It (film)|Go For It!]]'' (1983)
#''[[Double Trouble (1984 film)|Double Trouble]]'' (1984)
#''[[Miami Supercops]]'' (1985)
#''[[Troublemakers (film)|Troublemakers]]'' (1994)

#''[[Banana Joe (film)|Banana Joe]]'' (1982)
#''[[Bomber (1982 film)|Bomber]]'' (1982)
#''[[Superfantagenio]]'' (1986)

Many of these have alternative titles, depending upon the country and distributor. Some have longer Italian versions that were edited for release abroad. These films gathered popularity for both actors, especially in Europe.<ref name=imdb/>

The main dubber of Bud Spencer in Italy is [[Glauco Onorato]] who, with his characteristic voice, successfully enriched the character of Bud Spencer. Sergio Fiorentini dubbed Spencer in ''[[Troublemakers (film)|Troublemakers]]'', ''To the Limit'' (1997) and the series of [[Extralarge|Detective Extralarge]], (1991–93) while in the movie ''Everything Happens to Me'' the dubber is [[Ferruccio Amendola]].

Spencer also wrote the complete or partial screenplay for some of his movies. His feature film career slowed down after 1983, shifting more toward television. In the 1990s, he acted in the TV action-drama ''[[Extralarge]]''. His autobiography was published by Schwarzkopf & Schwarzkopf in 2011.

===Personal life===
Spencer married Maria Amato in 1960, with whom he had three children: Giuseppe (1961), Christine (1962) and Diamante (1972). After appearing in ''Più forte, ragazzi!'', Spencer became a jet airplane and helicopter pilot.<ref name=imdb/> He established [[Mistral Air]] in 1984, an air-mail company that also transports pilgrims, but later sold it to [[Poste Italiane]] to buy a textile mill that produced clothes for children.

===Career in politics===
In 2005, he entered politics, unsuccessfully standing as regional counselor in [[Lazio]] for the [[Forza Italia]] party. Spencer has stated: "In my life, I've done everything. There are only three things I haven't been – a ballet dancer, a jockey and a politician. Given that the first two jobs are out of the question, I'll throw myself into politics."<ref name=imdb/> The opposition criticised him for engaging in "politica spettacolo" ("showbiz politics").<ref name=imdb/>
