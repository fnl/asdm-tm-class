'''Gary Cooper''' (born '''Frank James Cooper'''; May 7, 1901 – May 13, 1961) was an American film actor known for his natural, authentic, and understated acting style and screen performances. His career spanned thirty-six years, from 1925 to 1961, and included leading roles in eighty-four feature films. He was a major movie star from the end of the [[silent film|silent film era]] through the end of the golden age of [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Classical Hollywood]]. His screen persona appealed strongly to both men and women, and his range of performances included roles in most major movie genres. Cooper's ability to project his own personality onto the characters he played contributed to his appearing natural and authentic on screen. The screen persona he sustained throughout his career represented the ideal American hero.

Cooper began his career as a film [[Extra (acting)|extra]] and [[Stunt performer|stunt rider]] and soon landed acting roles. After establishing himself as a Western hero in his early silent films, Cooper became a movie star in 1929 with his first sound picture ''[[The Virginian (1929 film)|The Virginian]]''. In the early 1930s, he expanded his heroic image to include more cautious characters in adventure films and dramas such as ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1932) and ''[[The Lives of a Bengal Lancer (film)|The Lives of a Bengal Lancer]]'' (1935). During the height of his career, Cooper portrayed a new type of hero—a champion of the common man—in films such as ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'' (1936), ''[[Meet John Doe]]'' (1941), ''[[Sergeant York (film)|Sergeant York]]'' (1941), ''[[The Pride of the Yankees]]'' (1942), and ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1943). In the post-war years, he portrayed more mature characters at odds with the world in films such as ''[[The Fountainhead (film)|The Fountainhead]]'' (1949) and ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952). In his final films, Cooper played non-violent characters searching for redemption in films such as ''[[Friendly Persuasion (film)|Friendly Persuasion]]'' (1956) and ''[[Man of the West]]'' (1958).

Cooper had romantic relationships early in his career with several leading actresses, including [[Clara Bow]] and [[Lupe Vélez]]. He married New York [[debutante]] [[Veronica Cooper|Veronica Balfe]] in 1933, and the couple had one daughter. Their marriage was interrupted by a three-year separation precipitated by Cooper's love affair with [[Patricia Neal]]. Cooper's twenty-year friendship with [[Ernest Hemingway]] was grounded in their mutual love for the outdoors. Cooper's other close friends included [[Howard Hawks]], [[Joel McCrea]], and [[James Stewart]]. Cooper received five [[Academy Award]] nominations for Best Actor, winning twice, for ''Sergeant York'' and ''High Noon''. He also received an [[33rd Academy Awards|Academy Honorary Award]] for his career achievements in 1961. He was one of the top ten film personalities for twenty-three consecutive years, and was one of the top money-making stars for eighteen years. The [[American Film Institute]] (AFI) ranked Cooper eleventh on its list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|fifty greatest male screen legends]].

In the summer of 1909, Alice, wanting her sons to have an English education, accompanied them to England and enrolled them in [[Dunstable Grammar School]] in Bedfordshire, where Cooper was educated from 1910 to 1912.<ref name="meyers-10-12">Meyers 1998, pp. 10–12.</ref><ref>Benson 1986, pp. 191–195.</ref>{{refn|While in England, Cooper and his brother lived with their father's cousins, William and Emily Barton, in their ancestral home known as "The White House" at 157 High Street North in [[Houghton Regis]] in Bedfordshire from 1909 to 1912.<ref name="meyers-10-12"/>|group=Note}} At Dunstable, Cooper studied Latin and French, and took several courses in English history.<ref>Swindell 1980, p. 19.</ref> While he managed to adapt to the discipline of an English school and learned the requisite social graces, he never adjusted to the rigid class structure and formal Eton [[Detachable collar|collars]] he was forced to wear.<ref>Swindell 1980, p. 21.</ref> After completing confirmation classes, Cooper was [[Baptism|baptized]] into the [[Anglicanism|Anglican Church]] on December 3, 1911, at the [[Church of All Saints, Houghton Regis|Church of All Saints]] in Houghton Regis.<ref name="meyers-13">Meyers 1998, p. 13.</ref><ref name="dunstable"/> Cooper's mother accompanied her sons back to the United States in August 1912, and Cooper resumed his education at Johnson Grammar School in Helena.<ref name="meyers-6"/>

In 1920, while still attending high school, Cooper took three art courses at [[Montana State University|Montana Agricultural College]].<ref name="meyers-21"/> His interest in art was inspired years earlier by the Western paintings of [[Charles Marion Russell]] and [[Frederic Remington]].<ref name="meyers-15-16">Meyers 1998, pp. 15–16.</ref> Cooper especially admired and studied Russell's ''Lewis and Clark Meeting Indians at Ross' Hole'' (1910), which still hangs in the state capitol building in Helena.<ref name="meyers-15-16"/> In 1922, Cooper enrolled in [[Grinnell College]] in [[Iowa]] to continue his art education.

==Career==

===Silent films, 1925–28===
[[File:Gary Cooper in The Winning of Barbara Worth 1926.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of Gary Cooper wearing a cowboy hat|Cooper in ''The Winning of Barbara Worth'', 1926]]
In early 1925, Cooper began his film career working in silent pictures such as ''[[The Thundering Herd (1925 film)|The Thundering Herd]]'' and ''[[Wild Horse Mesa (1925 film)|Wild Horse Mesa]]'' with [[Jack Holt (actor)|Jack Holt]],<ref name="swindell-62">Swindell 1980, p. 62.</ref> ''[[Riders of the Purple Sage (1925 film)|Riders of the Purple Sage]]'' and ''[[The Lucky Horseshoe]]'' with [[Tom Mix]],<ref name="swindell-63">Swindell 1980, p. 63.</ref><ref>Swindell 1980, p. 61.</ref> and ''[[The Trail Rider]]'' with [[Buck Jones]].<ref name="swindell-63"/> He worked for several Poverty Row studios, including [[Famous Players-Lasky]] and [[20th Century Fox|Fox Film Corporation]].<ref name="dickens-23-24">Dickens 1970, pp. 23–24.</ref> While his skills as a horseman led to steady work in Westerns, Cooper found the stunt work "tough and cruel", sometimes resulting in injury to the horses and riders.<ref name="swindell-62"/> Hoping to move beyond the risky stunt work and obtain acting roles, Cooper paid for a screen test and hired casting director Nan Collins to work as his agent.<ref>Meyers 1998, p. 28.</ref> Knowing that other actors were using the name "Frank Cooper", Collins suggested he change his first name to "Gary" after her hometown of [[Gary, Indiana|Gary]], Indiana.<ref>Meyers 1998, p. 29.</ref><ref>Swindell 1980, p. 66.</ref><ref>Arce 1979, p. 25.</ref> Cooper liked the name immediately.<ref>Swindell 1980, p. 67.</ref>{{refn|Cooper's popularity is largely responsible for the popularity of the given name Gary from the 1930s to the present day.<ref>Hanks and Hodges 2003, p. 106.</ref>|group=Note}}

Cooper also found work in a variety of non-Western films, appearing, for example, as a masked [[Cossacks|Cossack]] in ''[[The Eagle (1925 film)|The Eagle]]'' (1925), as a Roman guard in ''[[Ben-Hur (1925 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1925), and as a flood survivor in ''[[The Johnstown Flood (1926 film)|The Johnstown Flood]]'' (1926).<ref name="swindell-63"/> Gradually, he began to land credited roles that offered him more screen time, in films such as ''Tricks'' (1925), in which he played the film's [[antagonist]], and the [[short film]] ''Lightnin' Wins'' (1926).<ref>Rainey 1990, p. 66.</ref> As a featured player, he began to attract the attention of major film studios.<ref>Swindell 1980, p. 69.</ref> On June 1, 1926, Cooper signed a contract with [[Samuel Goldwyn Productions]] for fifty dollars a week.<ref name="meyers-30">Meyers 1998, p. 30.</ref>

Cooper's first important film role was in ''[[The Winning of Barbara Worth]]'' (1926) with [[Ronald Colman]] and [[Vilma Bánky]].<ref name="meyers-30"/> In the film, Cooper plays a young engineer, Abe Lee, who helps a rival suitor save the woman he loves and her town from an impending dam disaster.<ref>Dickens 1970, p. 29.</ref> Cooper's experience living among the Montana cowboys gave his performance an "instinctive authenticity", according to biographer Jeffrey Meyers.<ref name="meyers-31">Meyers 1998, p. 31.</ref> The film premiered on October 14 and was a major success.<ref>Swindell 1980, pp. 73–74.</ref> Critics singled out Cooper as a "dynamic new personality" and future star.<ref name="meyers-32">Meyers 1998, p. 32.</ref><ref>Swindell 1980, p. 74.</ref> Goldwyn rushed to offer the actor a long-term contract, but Cooper held out for a better deal—finally signing a five-year contract with [[Jesse L. Lasky]] at [[Paramount Pictures]] for $175 a week.<ref name="meyers-32"/> In 1927, with help from established movie star [[Clara Bow]], Cooper landed high-profile roles in ''[[Children of Divorce (1927 film)|Children of Divorce]]'' and ''[[Wings (1927 film)|Wings]]'', the latter being the first film to win an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].<ref name="oscars-1929"/> That year, Cooper also appeared in his first starring roles in ''[[Arizona Bound (1927 film)|Arizona Bound]]'' and ''[[Nevada (1927 film)|Nevada]]''—both films directed by [[John Waters (director born 1893)|John Waters]].<ref>Dickens 1970, pp. 35, 39.</ref>

In 1928, Paramount paired Cooper with a youthful [[Fay Wray]] in ''[[The Legion of the Condemned]]'' and ''[[The First Kiss (film)|The First Kiss]]''—advertising them as the studio's "glorious young lovers".<ref name="arce-51">Arce 1979, p. 51.</ref> Their on-screen chemistry failed to generate much excitement with audiences.<ref name="arce-51"/><ref>Meyers 1998, p. 44.</ref><ref name="dickens-7">Dickens 1970, p. 7.</ref> With each new film, Cooper's acting skills improved and his popularity continued to grow, especially among female movie-goers.<ref name="dickens-7"/> During this time, he was earning as much as $2,750 per film<ref>Meyers 1998, p. 47.</ref> and receiving a thousand fan letters a week.<ref>Swindell 1980, p. 93.</ref> Looking to exploit Cooper's growing audience appeal, the studio placed him opposite popular leading ladies such as [[Evelyn Brent]] in ''[[Beau Sabreur]]'', [[Florence Vidor]] in ''[[Doomsday (1928 film)|Doomsday]]'', and [[Esther Ralston]] in ''[[Half a Bride]]''.<ref name="swindell-98-99">Swindell 1980, pp. 98–99.</ref> That year, Cooper also made ''[[Lilac Time (1928 film)|Lilac Time]]'' with [[Colleen Moore]] for [[First National|First National Pictures]], his first movie with synchronized music and sound effects.<ref name="swindell-98-99"/> It became one of the most commercially successful films of 1928.<ref name="swindell-98-99"/>

===Hollywood stardom, 1929–35===
[[File:Gary Cooper and Mary Brian in The Virginian 1929.jpg|thumb|alt=Film still of Gary Cooper and Mary Brian|Cooper and Mary Brian in ''The Virginian'', 1929]]
Cooper became a major movie star in 1929 with the release of his first sound picture, ''[[The Virginian (1929 film)|The Virginian]]'', which was directed by [[Victor Fleming]] and co-starred [[Mary Brian]] and [[Walter Huston]].<ref>Dickens 1970, pp. 68–70.</ref> Based on the popular [[The Virginian (novel)|novel]] by [[Owen Wister]], ''The Virginian'' was one of the first sound films to define the Western code of honor and helped establish many of the conventions of the Western movie genre that have lasted to the present day.<ref>Meyers 1998, pp. 51–52.</ref> According to biographer Jeffrey Meyers, the romantic image of the tall, handsome, and shy cowboy hero who embodied male freedom, courage, and honor was created in large part by Cooper in the film.<ref>Meyers 1998, pp. 52–53.</ref> Unlike some silent film actors who had trouble adapting to the new sound medium, Cooper transitioned naturally, with his "deep and clear" and "pleasantly drawling" voice, which was perfectly suited for the characters he portrayed on screen, also according to  Meyers.<ref>Meyers 1998, p. 49.</ref> Looking to capitalize on Cooper's growing popularity, Paramount cast him in several Westerns and [[War film|wartime dramas]] in 1930, including ''[[Only the Brave (1930 film)|Only the Brave]]'', ''[[The Texan (film)|The Texan]]'', ''[[Seven Days' Leave (1930 film)|Seven Days' Leave]]'', ''[[A Man from Wyoming]]'', and ''[[The Spoilers (1930 film)|The Spoilers]]''.<ref>Dickens 1970, pp. 70–84.</ref>

[[File:Lili Damita-Gary Cooper in Fighting Caravans.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Film still of Lili Damita and Gary Cooper|Cooper and Lili Damita in ''Fighting Caravans'', 1931]]
One of the more important performances in Cooper's early career was his portrayal of a sullen [[French Foreign Legion|legionnaire]] in [[Josef von Sternberg]]'s 1930 film ''[[Morocco (film)|Morocco]]''<ref>Meyers 1998, p. 61.</ref> with [[Marlene Dietrich]] in her introduction to American audiences.<ref name="dickens-9">Dickens 1970, p. 9.</ref> During production, von Sternberg focused his energies on Dietrich and treated Cooper dismissively.<ref name="dickens-9"/> Tensions came to a head after von Sternberg yelled directions at Cooper in German. The {{convert|6|ft|3|in|cm|adj=on}} actor approached the {{convert|5|ft|4|in|cm|adj=on}} director, physically picked him up by the collar and said, "If you expect to work in this country you'd better get on to the language we use here."<ref>Meyers 1998, pp. 63–64.</ref><ref>Swindell 1980, p. 122.</ref> Despite the tensions on the set, Cooper produced "one of his best performances", according to Thornton Delehanty of the ''New York Evening Post''.<ref>Dickens 1970, p. 87.</ref> In 1931, after returning to the Western genre in [[Zane Grey]]'s ''[[Fighting Caravans]]'' with French actress [[Lili Damita]],<ref>Dickens 1970, pp. 89–91.</ref> Cooper appeared in the [[Dashiell Hammett]] [[crime film]] ''[[City Streets (film)|City Streets]]'' playing a westerner who gets involved with big-city gangsters in order to save the woman he loves.<ref>Dickens 1970, pp. 92–93.</ref> Cooper concluded the year with appearances in two unsuccessful films: ''[[I Take This Woman (1931 film)|I Take This Woman]]'' with [[Carole Lombard]], and ''[[His Woman]]'' with [[Claudette Colbert]].<ref>Dickens 1970, pp. 95–98.</ref> The demands and pressures of making ten films in two years left Cooper exhausted and in poor health, suffering from [[anemia]] and [[jaundice]].<ref name="dickens-9"/><ref name="meyers-73">Meyers 1998, p. 73.</ref> He had lost {{convert|30|lb|kg|spell=on}} during that period,<ref name="meyers-73"/><ref>Swindell 1980, p. 129.</ref> and felt lonely, isolated, and depressed by his sudden fame and wealth.<ref name="meyers-75">Meyers 1998, p. 75.</ref><ref>Arce 1979, p. 71.</ref> In May 1931, Cooper left Hollywood and sailed to [[Algiers]] and then Italy, where he lived for the next year.<ref name="meyers-75"/>

The year 1936 marked an important turning point in Cooper's career.<ref name="meyers-116">Meyers 1998, p. 116.</ref> After making [[Frank Borzage]]'s [[romantic comedy film]] ''[[Desire (1936 film)|Desire]]'' with Marlene Dietrich at Paramount—delivering a performance considered by some contemporary critics as one of his finest<ref name="meyers-116"/>—Cooper returned to Poverty Row for the first time since his early silent film days to make [[Frank Capra]]'s [[Screwball comedy film|screwball comedy]] ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'' with [[Jean Arthur]] for [[Columbia Pictures]].<ref>Swindell 1980, p. 188.</ref> In the film, Cooper plays the character of Longfellow Deeds, a quiet, innocent writer of greeting cards who inherits a fortune, leaves behind his idyllic life in Vermont, and travels to New York where he faces a world of corruption and deceit.<ref>Dickens 1970, p. 140.</ref> Capra and screenwriter [[Robert Riskin]] were able to use Cooper's well-established screen persona as the "quintessential American hero"<ref name="meyers-116"/>—a symbol of honesty, courage, and goodness<ref name="meyers-119">Meyers 1998, p. 119.</ref><ref name="swindell-192">Swindell 1980, p. 192.</ref><ref>Kaminsky 1979, p. 78.</ref>—to create a new type of "[[folk hero]]" for the common man.<ref name="meyers-116"/><ref>Arce 1979, p. 144.</ref> Commenting on Cooper's impact on the character and the film, Capra observed:
{{quote|As soon as I thought of Gary Cooper, it wasn't possible to conceive anyone else in the role. He could not have been any closer to my idea of Longfellow Deeds, and as soon as he could think in terms of Cooper, Bob Riskin found it easier to develop the Deeds character in terms of dialogue. So it just had to be Cooper. Every line in his face spelled honesty. Our Mr. Deeds had to symbolize uncorruptibility, and in my mind Gary Cooper was that symbol.<ref>Swindell 1980, p. 190.</ref>}}
Both ''Desire'' and ''Mr. Deeds'' opened in April 1936 to critical praise and were major box-office successes.<ref name="meyers-121">Meyers 1998, p. 121.</ref> In his review in ''The New York Times'', [[Frank Nugent]] wrote that Cooper was "proving himself one of the best light comedians in Hollywood".<ref name="nytimes-deeds"/> For his performance in ''Mr. Deeds'', Cooper received his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.<ref name="oscars-1937"/>

Cooper appeared in two other Paramount films in 1936.

Cooper's social life generally centered on sports, outdoor activities, and dinner parties with his family and friends from the film industry, including directors Henry Hathaway, Howard Hawks, William Wellman, and Fred Zinnemann, and actors Joel McCrea, James Stewart, Barbara Stanwyck, and Robert Taylor.<ref>Meyers 1998, pp. 104–105, 153, 313.</ref><ref>Janis 1999, p. 98.</ref><ref>Swindell 1980, pp. 300–301.</ref> As well as hunting, Cooper enjoyed riding, fishing, skiing, and later in life, scuba diving.<ref>Meyers 1998, pp. 59, 299.</ref><ref>Janis 1999, p. 124.</ref> He never abandoned his early love for art and drawing, and over the years, he and his wife acquired a private collection of modern paintings, including works by [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Paul Gauguin]], and [[Georgia O'Keeffe]].<ref name="meyers-285-286">Meyers 1998, pp. 285–286.</ref> Cooper owned several works by [[Pablo Picasso]], whom he met in 1956.<ref name="meyers-285-286"/> Cooper had a lifelong passion for automobiles, with a collection that included a 1930 [[Duesenberg]].<ref name="meyers-59">Meyers 1998, p. 59.</ref><ref>Janis 1999, p. 121.</ref>

Cooper was naturally reserved and introspective, and loved the solitude of outdoor activities.<ref name="meyers-53">Meyers 1998, p. 53.</ref> Not unlike his screen persona, his communication style frequently consisted of long silences<ref name="meyers-53"/> with an occasional "yup" and "shucks".<ref name="swindell-303"/><ref>Janis 1999, p. 6.</ref> He once said, "If others have more interesting things to say than I have, I keep quiet."<ref name="meyers-54">Meyers 1998, p. 54.</ref> According to his friends, Cooper could also be an articulate, well-informed conversationalist on topics ranging from horses, guns, and Western history to film production, sports cars, and modern art.<ref name="meyers-54"/> He was modest and unpretentious,<ref name="meyers-53"/> frequently downplaying his acting abilities and career accomplishments.<ref>Kaminsky 1979, p. 217.</ref> His friends and colleagues described him as charming, well-mannered, and thoughtful, with a lively boyish sense of humor.<ref name="meyers-54"/> Cooper maintained a sense of propriety throughout his career and never misused his movie star status—never sought special treatment or refused to work with a director or leading lady.<ref name="meyers-55">Meyers 1998, p. 55.</ref> His close friend Joel McCrea recalled, "Coop never fought, he never got mad, he never told anybody off that I know of; everybody that worked with him liked him."<ref name="meyers-55"/>

===Political views===
Cooper was a conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] like his father, and voted for [[Calvin Coolidge]] in 1924, [[Herbert Hoover]] in 1928 and 1932, and campaigned for [[Wendell Willkie]] in 1940.<ref name="meyers-202">Meyers 1998, p. 202.</ref> When [[Franklin D.

Our country is a young country that just has to make up its mind to be itself again."<ref name="meyers-206"/><ref>Carpozi 1970, p. 168.</ref> He also attended a Republican rally at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] that drew 93,000 Dewey supporters.<ref>Jordan 2011, pp. 231–232.</ref>

Cooper was one of the founding members of the [[Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals]],<ref>Swindell 1980, p. 256.</ref> a conservative organization dedicated, according to its statement of principles, to preserving the "American way of life" and opposing [[communism]] and [[fascism]].<ref name="alliance"/> The organization—whose membership included [[Walt Disney]], [[Clark Gable]], [[Ronald Reagan]], Barbara Stanwyck, and [[John Wayne]]—pressured the [[United States Congress]] to investigate communist influence in the motion picture industry.<ref>Meyers 1998, p. 207.</ref> On October 23, 1947, Cooper appeared before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) and was asked if he had observed any "communistic influence" in Hollywood.<ref name="virginia"/> Cooper recounted statements he'd heard suggesting that the Constitution was out of date and that Congress was an unnecessary institution—comments that Cooper said he found to be "very un-American".<ref name="virginia"/> He also testified that he had rejected several scripts because he thought they were "tinged with communist ideas".<ref name="virginia"/> Unlike some other witnesses, Cooper did not name any individuals during his testimony.<ref name="virginia"/><ref>Meyers 1998, p. 210.</ref>

===Religion===
Cooper was baptized in the Anglican Church in December 1911 in England,<ref name="meyers-13"/> and was raised in the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] in the United States.<ref name="carpozi-205">Carpozi 1970, p. 205.</ref> While he was never an observant Christian during his adult life, many of his friends believed he had a deeply spiritual side.<ref name="meyers-293">Meyers 1998, p. 293.</ref>

==Acting style and reputation==
{{Quote box|width=33% |align=right |quote="Naturalness is hard to talk about, but I guess it boils down to this: You find out what people expect of your type of character and then you give them what they want. That way, an actor never seems unnatural or affected no matter what role he plays."<ref>Meyers 1998, p. 120.</ref> |source=Gary Cooper}}
Cooper's acting style consisted of three essential characteristics: his ability to project elements of his own personality onto the characters he portrayed, to appear natural and authentic in his roles, and to underplay and deliver restrained performances calibrated for the camera and the screen. Acting teacher [[Lee Strasberg]] once observed: "The simplest examples of Stanislavsky's ideas are actors such as Gary Cooper, John Wayne, and Spencer Tracy. They try not to act but to be themselves, to respond or react. They refuse to say or do anything they feel not to be consonant with their own characters."<ref name="meyers-156">Meyers 1998, p. 156.</ref> Film director [[François Truffaut]] ranked Cooper among "the greatest actors" because of his ability to deliver great performances "without direction".<ref name="meyers-156"/> This ability to project elements of his own personality onto his characters produced a continuity across his performances to the extent that critics and audiences were convinced that he was simply "playing himself".<ref name="kaminsky-2"/>

Cooper's ability to project his personality onto his characters played an important part in his appearing natural and authentic on screen. Actor [[John Barrymore]] said of Cooper, "This fellow is the world's greatest actor. He does without effort what the rest of us spend our lives trying to learn—namely, to be natural."<ref name="meyers-89"/> [[Charles Laughton]], who played opposite Cooper in ''Devil and the Deep'' agreed, "In truth, that boy hasn't the least idea how well he acts ... He gets at it from the inside, from his own clear way of looking at life."<ref name="meyers-89"/> William Wyler, who directed Cooper in two films, called him a "superb actor, a master of movie acting".<ref>Dickens 1970, pp. 18–19.</ref> In his review of Cooper's performance in ''The Real Glory'', Graham Greene wrote, "Sometimes his lean photogenic face seems to leave everything to the lens, but there is no question here of his not acting. Watch him inoculate the girl against cholera—the casual jab of the needle, and the dressing slapped on while he talks, as though a thousand arms had taught him where to stab and he doesn't have to think anymore."<ref name="meyers-89"/>

Cooper's style of underplaying before the camera surprised many of his directors and fellow actors. Even in his earliest feature films, he recognized the camera's ability to pick up slight gestures and facial movements.<ref>Kaminsky 1979, pp. 2–3.</ref> Commenting on Cooper's performance in ''Sergeant York'', director Howard Hawks observed, "He worked very hard and yet he didn't seem to be working. He was a strange actor because you'd look at him during a scene and you'd think ... this isn't going to be any good. But when you saw the rushes in the projection room the next day you could read in his face all the things he'd been thinking."<ref name="meyers-153"/> Sam Wood, who directed Cooper in four films, had similar observations about Cooper's performance in ''Pride of the Yankees'', noting, "What I thought was underplaying turned out to be just the right approach. On the screen he's perfect, yet on the set you'd swear it's the worst job of acting in the history of motion pictures."<ref>Meyers 1998, p. 165.</ref> His fellow actors also admired his abilities as an actor. Commenting on her two films playing opposite Cooper, actress Ingrid Bergman concluded, "The personality of this man was so enormous, so overpowering—and that expression in his eyes and his face, it was so delicate and so underplayed. You just didn't notice it until you saw it on the screen. I thought he was marvelous; the most underplaying and the most natural actor I ever worked with."<ref name="meyers-179"/>

In over half of his feature films, Cooper portrayed Westerners, soldiers, pilots, sailors, and explorers—all men of action.<ref name="kaminsky-2">Kaminsky 1979, p. 2.</ref> In the rest he played a wide range of characters, included doctors, professors, artists, architects, clerks, and baseball players.<ref name="kaminsky-2"/> Cooper's heroic screen image changed with each period of his career.<ref name="kaminsky-219">Kaminsky 1979, p. 219.</ref> In his early films, he played the young naive hero sure of his moral position and trusting in the triumph of simple virtues (''The Virginian'').<ref name="kaminsky-219"/> After becoming a major star, his Western screen persona was replaced by a more cautious hero in adventure films and dramas (''A Farewell to Arms'').<ref name="kaminsky-219"/> During the height of his career, from 1936 to 1943, he played a new type of hero—a champion of the common man willing to sacrifice himself for others (''Mr. Deeds'', ''Meet John Doe'', and ''For Whom the Bell Tolls'').<ref name="kaminsky-219"/> In the post-war years, Cooper attempted broader variations on his screen image, which now reflected a hero increasingly at odds with the world who must face adversity alone (''The Fountainhead'' and ''High Noon'').<ref>Kaminsky 1979, pp. 219–220.</ref> In his final films, Cooper's hero rejects the violence of the past, and seeks to reclaim lost honor and find redemption (''Friendly Persuasion'' and ''Man of the West'').<ref>Kaminsky 1979, pp. 220–221.</ref> The screen persona he developed and sustained throughout his career represented the ideal American hero—a tall, handsome, and sincere man of steadfast integrity<ref>Dickens 1970, p. 1.</ref> who emphasized action over intellect, and combined the heroic qualities of the romantic lover, the adventurer, and the common man.<ref>Meyers 1998, p. 324.</ref>

On February 6, 1960, Cooper was awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6243 Hollywood Boulevard for his contribution to the film industry.<ref name="walk-of-fame"/> He was also awarded a star on the sidewalk outside the Ellen Theater in Bozeman, Montana.<ref name="swmm-kinnaman"/> On May 6, 1961, he was awarded the French [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres|Order of Arts and Letters]] in recognition of his significant contribution to the arts.<ref name="meyers-308"/> On July 30, 1961, he was posthumously awarded the [[David di Donatello]] Special Award in Italy for his career achievements.<ref name="david"/> In 1966, he was inducted into the [[Hall of Great Western Performers]] at the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]] in Oklahoma City.<ref name="ncm"/> The [[American Film Institute]] (AFI) ranked Cooper eleventh on its list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|fifty greatest male screen legends]].<ref name="afi-stars"/> Three of his characters—Will Kane, Lou Gehrig, and Sergeant York—made AFI's list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains|one hundred greatest heroes and villains]], all of them as heroes.<ref name="afi-heroes"/> His Lou Gehrig line, "Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.", is ranked by AFI as the thirty-eighth greatest movie quote of all time.<ref name="afi-quotes"/> More than a half century after his death, Cooper's enduring legacy, according to biographer Jeffrey Meyers, is his image of the ideal American hero preserved in his film performances.<ref>Meyers 1998, pp. 323–324.</ref> Charlton Heston once observed, "He projected the kind of man Americans would like to be, probably more than any actor that's ever lived."<ref>Kaminsky 1979, p. 206.</ref>
