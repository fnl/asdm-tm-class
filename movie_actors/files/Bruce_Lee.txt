Lee was born in [[Chinatown, San Francisco]] on November 27, 1940 to parents from [[Hong Kong]] and was raised in [[Kowloon]] with his family until his late teens. He was introduced to the film industry by his father and appeared in several films as a child actor. Lee moved to the [[United States]] at the age of 18 to receive his higher education, at the [[University of Washington]], at Seattle<ref name="TheBruceLeeStory41">{{harvnb|Lee|1989|p=41}}</ref> and it was during this time that he began teaching martial arts. His [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] and [[Hollywood]]-produced films elevated the traditional [[Hong Kong action cinema|Hong Kong martial arts film]] to a new level of popularity and acclaim, sparking a surge of interest in [[Chinese martial arts]] in the West in the 1970s. The direction and tone of his films changed and influenced martial arts and [[martial arts film]]s in the United States, Hong Kong and the rest of the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-07-01/news-interviews/28300963_1_martial-arts-dev-patel-bruce-lee |title=Bruce Lee inspired Dev for martial arts |work=The Times of India |date=July 1, 2010 |accessdate=June 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=December 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>

He is noted for his roles in five feature-length films: [[Lo Wei]]'s ''[[The Big Boss]]'' (1971) and ''[[Fist of Fury]]'' (1972); [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]]'s ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'' (1972), directed and written by Lee; [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]] and [[Warner Brothers]]' ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' (1973)  and ''[[Game of Death|The Game of Death]]'' (1978), both directed by [[Robert Clouse]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-cinemaplus/article2058091.ece |title=How Bruce Lee changed the world-Series |work=The Hindu |location=India |date=May 29, 2011 |accessdate=June 3, 2011}}</ref> Lee became an iconic figure known throughout the world, particularly among the [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], as he portrayed [[Chinese nationalism]] in his films.<ref>{{harvnb|Dennis|1974|p=}}</ref> He  trained in the art of [[Wing Chun]] and later combined his other influences from various sources, in the spirit of his personal martial arts philosophy, which he dubbed [[Jeet Kune Do]] (The Way of the Intercepting Fist).

[[File:Bruce Lee with his parents 1940s.jpg|thumb|left|Bruce Lee as a baby.]]

Bruce Lee was born on November 27, 1940, at the [[San Francisco Chinese Hospital|Chinese Hospital]], in [[San Francisco]]'s [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]]. According to the [[Chinese zodiac]], Lee was born in both the hour and the year of the [[Dragon (zodiac)|Dragon]], which according to tradition is a strong and fortuitous omen.<ref name="bruceleefoundation biography">{{cite web|url=http://www.bruceleefoundation.com/index.cfm/page/About-Bruce-Lee/pid/10378|title=Biography|publisher=Bruce Lee Foundation|accessdate=June 7, 2010}}</ref>

Bruce's father, [[Lee Hoi-chuen]], (李海泉) was [[Han Chinese]], and his mother, Grace Ho (何愛瑜), was of half Chinese and half Caucasian.<ref>Description of the parent's racial makeup as described by Robert Lee at minute mark 3:35 in the cable television documentary, ''First Families: Bruce Lee'', which premiered on Fox Family on October 26, 1999.</ref> Specifically, Grace Ho was purportedly a half-German Catholic.<ref name="TheBruceLeeStory20">{{harvnb|Lee|1989|p=20}}</ref> Grace Ho was the daughter of Ho Kom-tong (Ho Gumtong, 何甘棠) and the niece of [[Robert Ho|Sir Robert Ho-tung]], both notable Hong Kong businessmen and philanthropists.<ref name="People's Republic of China">{{cite web|url=http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/147meeting/AAB-46%20Annex%20B.pdf|title=Kom Tong Hall at 7 Castle Road, Mid-levels, Hong Kong|publisher=People's Republic of China|accessdate=September 12, 2010}}</ref> Bruce was the fourth child of five children: Phoebe Lee (李秋源), Agnes Lee (李秋鳳), Peter Lee (李忠琛), and [[Robert Lee (musician)|Robert Lee]] (李振輝).

===Names===
[[File:Bruce Lee and his family 1940s.jpg|thumb|Bruce Lee and his family, when he was a child.]]

Lee's [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] birth name was ''[[Li (李)|Lee]] Jun-fan'' (李振藩).<ref name=Bio-TBLS>振藩; Mandarin [[Pinyin]]: Zhènfán){{harvnb|Lee|1989}}</ref> The name homophonically means "return again", and was given to Lee by his mother, who felt he would return to the United States once he came of age.<ref name="TheBruceLeeStory20">{{harvnb|Lee|1989|p=20}}</ref> Because of his mother's superstitious nature, she had originally named him ''Sai-fon'' (細鳳), which is a feminine name meaning "small phoenix".<ref name="Bruce Lee 2002"/> The English name "Bruce" is thought to have been given by the hospital attending physician, Dr. Mary Glover.<ref name=Bio-BLTUS>{{cite book|title=Bruce Lee The Untold Story|first=Grace|last=Lee|publisher=CFW Enterprise|location=United States|year=1980}}</ref>

Lee had three other Chinese names: '''Li Yuanxin''' (李源鑫), a family/clan name; '''Li Yuanjian''' (李元鑒), which he used as a student name while he was attending [[La Salle College]], and his Chinese screen name '''Li Xiaolong''' (李小龍; ''Xiaolong'' means "little dragon"). Lee's given name '''Jun-fan''' was originally written in Chinese as 震藩, however, the ''Jun'' (震) [[Chinese character]] was identical to part of his grandfather's name, Lee Jun-biu (李震彪). Hence, the Chinese character for ''Jun'' in Lee's name was changed to the [[homonym]] 振 instead, to avoid [[naming taboo]] in Chinese tradition.

===Family===
Lee's father, [[Lee Hoi-chuen]], was one of the leading [[Cantonese opera]] and film actors at the time, and was embarking on a year-long opera tour with his family on the eve of the [[Battle of Hong Kong|Japanese invasion of Hong Kong]]. Lee Hoi-chuen had been touring the United States for many years and performing at numerous Chinese communities there.

Although many of his peers decided to stay in the United States, Lee Hoi-chuen returned to Hong Kong after Bruce's birth. Within months, Hong Kong was invaded and the Lees lived for three years and eight months under [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong|Japanese occupation]]. After the war ended, Lee Hoi-chuen resumed his acting career and became a more popular actor during Hong Kong's rebuilding years.

Lee's mother, Grace Ho, was from one of the wealthiest and most powerful clans in Hong Kong, the Ho-tungs. She was the niece of [[Robert Ho|Sir Robert Ho-tung]],<ref name="People's Republic of China"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/Museum/History/en/pspecial_8.php|title=Kom Tong Hall and the Dr Sun Yat-sen Museum|date=January 10, 2005|publisher=People's Republic of China|accessdate=September 12, 2010}}</ref> the Eurasian patriarch of the clan. As such, the young Bruce Lee grew up in an affluent and privileged environment. Despite the advantage of his family's status, the neighborhood in which Lee grew up became overcrowded, dangerous, and full of gang rivalries due to an influx of refugees fleeing [[China|communist China]] for Hong Kong, at that time a British [[Crown colony]].<ref name="Bruce Lee 2002">Bruce Lee: the immortal Dragon, January 29, 2002, A&E Television Networks</ref>

After Lee was involved in several street fights, his parents decided that he needed to be trained in the martial arts. Lee's first introduction to martial arts was through his father, from whom he learned the fundamentals of [[Wu-style t'ai chi ch'uan]].<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|1994|p=14}}</ref>

===Wing Chun===
{{See also|History of Wing Chun}}
[[File:Before 18 years old Bruce Lee.jpg|thumb|Lee, before the age of 18.]]

The largest influence on Lee's martial arts development was his study of [[Wing Chun]]. Lee began training in Wing Chun when he was 16 years old under the Wing Chun teacher [[Yip Man]] in 1957, after losing several fights with rival gang members. Yip's regular classes generally consisted of the forms practice, ''chi sao'' (sticking hands) drills, [[Muk Yan Jong|wooden dummy]] techniques, and free-sparring.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Black Belt: Bruce Lee Collector's Edition'' Summer 1993</ref> There was no set pattern to the classes.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Yip tried to keep his students from fighting in the street gangs of Hong Kong by encouraging them to fight in organized competitions.<ref>''Black Belt: Bruce Lee Collector's Edition'' Summer 1993, p. 18</ref>

After a year into his Wing Chun training, most of Yip Man's other students refused to train with Lee after they learned of his mixed ancestry, as the Chinese were generally against teaching their martial arts techniques to non-Asians.<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|1994|p=26}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Sharif|2009|p=56}}</ref> Lee's sparring partner, Hawkins Cheung states, "Probably fewer than six people in the whole Wing Chun clan were personally taught, or even partly taught, by Yip Man".<ref>Black Belt: Bruce Lee Collector's Edition Summer 1993 p. 19</ref> However, Lee showed a keen interest in Wing Chun, and continued to train privately with [[Yip Man]] and [[Wong Shun Leung]] in 1955.<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2006|p=172}}</ref> [[Wan Kam Leung]], a student of Wong's, witnessed a sparring bout between Wong and Lee, and noted the speed and precision with which Lee was able to deliver his kicks.  Lee continued to train with Wong Shun Leung after later returning to Hong Kong from America.

===Leaving Hong Kong===
[[File:The age of 18 Bruce Lee and Ye Wen.jpg|thumb|left|Lee and his teacher Yip Man.]]

After attending Tak Sun School (德信學校) (several blocks from his home at 218 Nathan Road, [[Kowloon]]), Lee entered the primary school division of [[La Salle College]] at the age of 12. In around 1956, due to poor academic performance (or possibly poor conduct as well), he was transferred to [[St. Francis Xavier's College]] (high school) where he would be mentored by Brother Edward, a teacher and coach of the school boxing team.

[[File:Bruce Lee in 1958.jpg|thumb|Lee in 1958, dancing Cha-cha.]]
In the spring of 1959, Lee got into yet another street fight and the police were called.<ref>{{cite web

Until his late teens, Lee's street fights became more frequent and included beating the son of a feared [[Triad (underground society)|triad]] family.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Eventually, Lee's father decided his son should leave Hong Kong to pursue a safer and healthier avenue in the United States. His parents confirmed the police's fear that this time Lee's opponent had an [[organised crime]] background, and there was the possibility that a contract was out for his life.

{{quote|The police detective came and he says "Excuse me Mr. Lee, your son is really fighting bad in school. If he gets into just one more fight I might have to put him in jail".|[[Lee Hoi-chuen|Robert Lee]]<ref name="Bruce Lee 2002"/>}}

In April 1959, Lee's parents decided to send him to the United States to stay with his older sister, Agnes Lee (李秋鳳), who was already living with family friends in San Francisco.

===New life in America===
[[File:Bruce Lee - son.jpg|thumb|upright|With son Brandon in 1966]]
At the age of 18, Lee returned to the United States with $100 in his pocket. After living in San Francisco for several months, he moved to [[Seattle]] in 1959, to continue his high school education, where he also worked for [[Ruby Chow]] as a live-in waiter at her restaurant.

Chow's husband was a co-worker and friend of Lee's father. Lee's elder brother Peter Lee (李忠琛) would also join him in Seattle for a short stay before moving on to [[Minnesota]] to attend college. In December 1960, Lee completed his high school education and received his diploma from Edison Technical School (now [[Seattle Central Community College]], located on [[Capitol Hill (Seattle)|Capitol Hill]] in Seattle).

In March 1961, Lee enrolled at the [[University of Washington]], majoring in drama according to a 1999 article in the university's alumni magazine,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/alumni/columns/dec99/j_o.html |title=U. of Washington alumni records |publisher=Washington.edu |accessdate=January 22, 2010}}</ref> not in philosophy as stated by Lee himself and many others. Lee also studied philosophy, [[psychology]], and various other subjects.<ref>{{harvnb|Little|2001|p=32}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|1994|p=42}}</ref> It was at the University of Washington that he met his future wife [[Linda Lee Cadwell|Linda Emery]], a fellow student studying to become a teacher, whom he married in August 1964.

Lee had two children with Linda Emery, [[Brandon Lee]] (1965–93) and [[Shannon Lee]] (born 1969).

==Martial arts career==

===Jun Fan Gung Fu===
Lee began teaching martial arts in the United States in 1959. He called what he taught Jun Fan Gung Fu (literally Bruce Lee's Kung Fu). It was basically his approach to [[Wing Chun]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 30, 2008|url=http://hardcorejkd.com/wing_chun.php|title=WING CHUN GUNG FU|publisher=Hardcore JKD}}</ref> Lee taught friends he met in Seattle, starting with [[Judo]] practitioner [[Jesse Glover]], who continued to teach some of Lee's early techniques. [[Taky Kimura]] became Lee's first Assistant Instructor and continued to teach his art and philosophy after Lee's death.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=September 4, 2012|url= http://bruceleefoundation.com/index.cfm/page/Biography/pid/10585
|title= Bruce Lee Biography |publisher=Bruce Lee Foundation}}</ref> Lee opened his first [[Kwoon|martial arts school]], named the Lee Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute, in Seattle.

Lee dropped out of college in the spring of 1964 and moved to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] to live with [[James Yimm Lee]] (嚴鏡海). James Lee was twenty years senior to Bruce Lee and a well known Chinese martial artist in the area. Together, they founded the second Jun Fan martial art studio in Oakland. James Lee was also responsible for introducing Bruce Lee to [[Ed Parker]], American martial artist, and organizer of the [[Long Beach International Karate Championships]] at which Bruce Lee was later "discovered" by Hollywood.

===Long Beach International Karate Championships===
At the invitation of [[Ed Parker]], Lee appeared in the 1964 [[Long Beach International Karate Championships]]<ref name="ikc">{{cite web|accessdate=May 30, 2008|url=http://www.longbeachikc.com/|title=2007 Long Beach International Karate Championship|publisher=Long Beach International Karate Championship}}</ref> and performed repetitions of two-finger push-ups (using the thumb and the index finger of one hand) with feet at approximately a shoulder-width apart. In the same Long Beach event he also performed the "[[One inch punch]]."<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 30, 2008|url=http://www.maniacworld.com/bruce_lee_3.htm|title=Two Finger Pushup|publisher=Maniac World}}</ref> Lee stood upright, his right foot forward with knees bent slightly, in front of a standing, stationary partner. Lee's right arm was partly extended and his right fist approximately an inch away from the partner's chest. Without retracting his right arm, Lee then forcibly delivered the punch to his partner while largely maintaining his posture, sending the partner backwards and falling into a chair said to be placed behind the partner to prevent injury, though his partner's momentum soon caused him to fall to the floor. His volunteer was Bob Baker of [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], California. "I told Bruce not to do this type of demonstration again", Baker recalled. "When he punched me that last time, I had to stay home from work because the pain in my chest was unbearable".<ref>{{harvnb|Vaughn|1986|p=21}}</ref>

It was at the 1964 championships where Lee first met [[Taekwondo]] master [[Jhoon Goo Rhee]]. The two developed a friendship&nbsp;– a relationship from which they benefited as martial artists. Rhee taught Lee the [[side kick]] in detail, and Lee taught Rhee the "non-telegraphic" punch.<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Nilsson|first = Thomas|date=May 1996|title = With Bruce Lee: Taekwondo Pioneer Jhoon Rhee Recounts His 10-Year Friendship With the "Dragon"|magazine = [[Black Belt Magazine]]|volume = 34|issue = 5|pages = 39–43|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=H9oDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39&dq=#v=onepage&q=&f=false|accessdate =November 19, 2009}}

{{anchor|unstoppable}}
Lee appeared at the 1967 [[Long Beach International Karate Championships]] and performed various demonstrations, including the famous "unstoppable punch" against USKA world [[Karate]] champion [[Vic Moore]].<ref name="ikc" /> Lee told Moore that he was going to throw a straight punch to the face, and all he had to do was to try to block it. Lee took several steps back and asked if Moore was ready, when Moore nodded in affirmation, Lee glided towards him until he was within striking range. He then threw a straight punch directly at Moore's face, and stopped before impact. In eight attempts, Moore failed to block any of the punches.<ref>{{harvnb|Uyehara|1993|p=27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cbt9Xfs1-bo|title=Bruce Lee Victor Moore unblockable closing Long Beach International Tournament 60s|publisher=YouTube|date=June 11, 2009|accessdate=February 24, 2013}}</ref>

===Fight with Wong Jack Man===
In [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], California in 1964 at [[Chinatown, Oakland|Chinatown]], Lee had a controversial private match with [[Wong Jack Man]], a direct student of Ma Kin Fung known for his mastery of [[Xingyiquan]], [[Northern Shaolin (martial art)|Northern Shaolin]], and [[T'ai chi ch'uan]]. According to Lee, the Chinese community issued an ultimatum to him to stop teaching non-Chinese. When he refused to comply, he was challenged to a combat match with Wong. The arrangement was that if Lee lost, he would have to shut down his school; while if he won, then Lee would be free to teach [[White people|Caucasians]] or anyone else.<ref name="ReferenceB">''Bruce Lee: The Immortal Dragon'', January 29, 2002, A&E Television Networks</ref> Wong denied this, stating that he requested to fight Lee after Lee issued an open challenge during one of Lee's demonstrations at a Chinatown theatre, and that Wong himself did not discriminate against Caucasians or other non-Chinese.<ref name="Dorgan">{{harvnb|Dorgan|1980|p=}}</ref> Lee commented, "That paper had all the names of the [[sifu]] from Chinatown, but they don't scare me".<ref>''Black Belt: Bruce Lee Collector's Edition'', Summer 1993 Rainbow Publications Inc, p. 117</ref>

Individuals known to have witnessed the match included Cadwell, James Lee (Bruce Lee's associate, no relation), and William Chen, a teacher of T'ai chi ch'uan. Wong and witness William Chen stated that the fight lasted an unusually long 20–25 minutes.<ref name="Dorgan"/> According to Bruce Lee, [[Linda Lee Cadwell]], and [[James Yimm Lee]], the fight lasted 3 minutes with a decisive victory for Lee. "The fight ensued, it was a no-holds-barred fight, it took three minutes. Bruce got this guy down to the ground and said 'do you give up?' and the man said he gave up"&nbsp;– Linda Lee Cadwell.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

[[Wong Jack Man]] published his own account of the battle in the Chinese ''Pacific Weekly'', a [[Chinese-language]] newspaper in San Francisco, which contained another challenge to Lee for a public rematch.<ref name="Dorgan"/> Lee had no reciprocation to Wong's article, nor were there any further public announcements by either, but Lee had continued to teach Caucasians.

===Jeet Kune Do===
[[File:JeetKuneDo.svg|thumb|The [[Jeet Kune Do]] emblem is a registered trademark held by the Bruce Lee Estate. The [[Chinese character]]s around the [[Taijitu]] symbol read: "Using no way as way" and "Having no limitation as limitation" The arrows represent the endless interaction between yang and yin.<ref>{{harvnb|Bishop|2004|p=23}}</ref>]]
{{Main|Jeet Kune Do}}
Jeet Kune Do originated in 1967. After filming one season of ''[[The Green Hornet (TV series)|The Green Hornet]]'', Lee found himself out of work and opened The Jun Fan Institute of Gung Fu. The controversial match with [[Wong Jack Man]] influenced Lee's philosophy about martial arts. Lee concluded that the fight had lasted too long and that he had failed to live up to his potential using his [[Wing Chun]] techniques. He took the view that traditional martial arts techniques were too rigid and formalistic to be practical in scenarios of chaotic [[street fighting]]. Lee decided to develop a system with an emphasis on "practicality, flexibility, speed, and efficiency". He started to use different methods of training such as [[weight training]] for strength, running for endurance, stretching for flexibility, and many others which he constantly adapted, including fencing and basic boxing techniques.

Lee emphasised what he called "the style of no style". This consisted of getting rid of the formalised approach which Lee claimed was indicative of traditional styles. Lee felt the system he now called Jun Fan Gung Fu was even too restrictive, and eventually evolved into a philosophy and martial art he would come to call ''Jeet Kune Do'' or the ''Way of the Intercepting Fist.'' It is a term he would later regret, because Jeet Kune Do implied specific parameters that styles connote; whereas the idea of his martial art was to exist outside of parameters and limitations.<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|1994|p=81}}</ref>

===Fitness and nutrition===
At {{convert|173|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} and {{convert|64|kg|lb|abbr=on}},<ref>{{cite web|title=Bruce Lee|url=http://www.china.org.cn/top10/chinese_celebrities_vote/2012-08/28/content_26356156.htm|website=china.org.cn|accessdate=July 2, 2014}}</ref> Lee was renowned for his physical fitness and vigor, achieved by using a dedicated fitness regimen to become as strong as possible. After his match with [[Wong Jack Man]] in 1965, Lee changed his approach toward martial arts training. Lee felt that many martial artists of his time did not spend enough time on physical conditioning. Lee included all elements of total fitness—muscular strength, muscular endurance, cardiovascular endurance, and flexibility. He used traditional [[bodybuilding]] techniques to build some muscle mass, not overdone that could decrease speed or flexibility. At the same time in balance, Lee was careful to admonish that mental and spiritual preparation are fundamental to the success of physical training in martial arts skills. In ''[[Tao of Jeet Kune Do]]'' he wrote,

{{quote|Training is one of the most neglected phases of athletics. Too much time is given to the development of skill and too little to the development of the individual for participation.&nbsp;... JKD, ultimately is not a matter of petty techniques but of highly developed spirituality and physique.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 30, 2008|url=http://www.hybridmartialart.com/Martial%20Art%20Overview/Martial_%20Arts_%20Overview.html|title=Martial Art Disciplines at Hybrid Martial Arts Academy |publisher=Hybrid Martial Art}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>}}

According to [[Linda Lee Cadwell]], soon after he moved to the United States, Lee started to take nutrition seriously and developed an interest in health foods, high-protein drinks and vitamin and mineral supplements. He later concluded that in order to achieve a high-performance body, one could not fuel it with a diet of junk food, and with "the wrong fuel" one's body would perform sluggishly or sloppily.<ref>{{harvnb|Little|1998|p=162}}</ref> Lee also avoided baked goods and refined flour, describing them as providing calories which did nothing for his body.<ref>{{harvnb|Little|1998|p=163}}</ref>

Lee's father [[Lee Hoi-chuen]] was a famous [[Cantonese opera]] star. Because of this, Lee was introduced into films at a very young age and appeared in several films as a child. Lee had his first role as a baby who was carried onto the stage in the film ''[[Golden Gate Girl]]''. By the time he was 18, he had appeared in twenty films.<ref name="bruceleefoundation biography"/>

While in the United States from 1959 to 1964, Lee abandoned thoughts of a film career in favour of pursuing martial arts. However, a martial arts exhibition on Long Beach in 1964 eventually led to the invitation by [[William Dozier]] for an audition for a part in the pilot for "Number One Son". The show never aired, but Lee was invited for the role of [[Kato (The Green Hornet)|Kato]] alongside [[Van Williams]] in the TV series ''[[The Green Hornet (TV series)|The Green Hornet]]''. The show lasted just one season, from 1966 to 1967. Lee also played Kato in three crossover episodes of ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]''. This was followed by guest appearances in three television series: ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'' (1967), ''[[Here Come the Brides]]'' (1969), and ''Blondie'' (1969).

At the time, two of Lee's martial arts students were Hollywood script writer [[Stirling Silliphant]] and actor [[James Coburn]]. In 1969 the three worked on a script for a film called ''The Silent Flute'', and went together on a location hunt to [[India]]. The project was not realised at the time; but the 1978 film ''[[Circle of Iron]]'', starring David Carradine, was based on the same plot. In 2010, producer Paul Maslansky was reported to plan and receive fundings for a film based on the original script for ''The Silent Flute''.<ref>{{cite news|last=McNary |first=Dave |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118017805.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 |title=Bruce Lee's 'Flute' heads to bigscreen&nbsp;– Entertainment News, Film News, Media |publisher=Variety |date=April 15, 2010 |accessdate=February 22, 2011}}</ref> In 1969, Lee made a brief appearance in the Silliphant-penned film ''[[Marlowe (film)|Marlowe]]'' where he played a henchman hired to intimidate private detective [[Philip Marlowe]], (played by [[James Garner]]), by smashing up his office with leaping kicks and flashing punches, only to later accidentally jump off a tall building while trying to kick Marlowe off. The same year he also choreographed fight scenes for ''[[The Wrecking Crew (1969 film)|The Wrecking Crew]]'' starring [[Dean Martin]], [[Sharon Tate]], and featuring [[Chuck Norris]] in his first role. In 1970, he was responsible for fight choreography for ''[[A Walk in the Spring Rain]]'' starring [[Ingrid Bergman]] and [[Anthony Quinn]], again written by Silliphant. In 1971, Lee appeared in four episodes of the television series ''[[Longstreet (TV series)|Longstreet]]'', written by Silliphant. Lee played the martial arts instructor of the title character Mike Longstreet (played by [[James Franciscus]]), and important aspects of his martial arts philosophy were written into the script.

According to statements made by Lee, and also by [[Linda Lee Cadwell]] after Lee's death, in 1971 Lee pitched a television series of his own tentatively titled ''The Warrior'', discussions which were also confirmed by [[Warner Bros.]] In a December 9, 1971 television interview on ''[[The Pierre Berton Show]]'', Lee stated that both Paramount and Warner Brothers wanted him "to be in a modernized type of a thing, and that they think the Western idea is out, whereas I want to do the Western".<ref>From {{YouTube|hN8PfMdBIjw|The Pierre Berton Show}} December 9, 1971 (comments at 7:10 of part 2)</ref> According to Cadwell, however, Lee's concept was retooled and renamed ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'', but [[Warner Bros.]] gave Lee no credit.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|1975a|p=}}</ref> Warner Brothers states that they had for some time been developing an identical concept,<ref>Bleecker, Tom (1996). Unsettled Matters. The Life & Death of Bruce Lee. Gilderoy Publications</ref> created by two writers and producers, Ed Spielman and Howard Friedlander. According to these sources, the reason Lee was not cast was in part because of his ethnicity, but more so because he had a thick accent.<ref>{{YouTube|PlYdp1BVOlw|"From Grasshopper to Caine"}}</ref> The role of the [[Shaolin Kung Fu|Shaolin]] monk in the [[American Old West|Wild West]], was eventually awarded to then-non-martial-artist [[David Carradine]]. In ''The Pierre Berton Show'' interview, Lee stated he understood Warner Brothers' attitudes towards casting in the series: "They think that business wise it is a risk. I don't blame them. If the situation were reversed, and an American star were to come to Hong Kong, and I was the man with the money, I would have my own concerns as to whether the acceptance would be there".<ref>From {{YouTube|uXOtmhA6Nvw|The Pierre Berton Show}} December 9, 1971 (comments near end of part 2 & early in part 3)</ref>

[[File:Wan Kam Leung and Bruce Lee.jpg|left|thumb|[[Wan Kam Leung]] and Bruce Lee in a screen test for ''[[Game of Death]]''.]]Producer Fred Weintraub had advised Lee to return to Hong Kong and make a feature film which he could showcase to executives in Hollywood.<ref>Tale of the Dragon (Channel 4), directed by Jess Search</ref> Not happy with his supporting roles in the United States, Lee returned to Hong Kong. Unaware that ''[[The Green Hornet (TV series)|The Green Hornet]]'' had been played to success in Hong Kong and was unofficially referred to as "The Kato Show", he was surprised to be recognised on the street as the star of the show. After negotiating with both [[Shaw Brothers Studio]] and [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]], Lee signed a film contract to star in two films produced by Golden Harvest. Lee played his first leading role in ''[[The Big Boss]]'' (1971) which proved to be an enormous box office success across Asia and catapulted him to stardom. He soon followed up with ''[[Fist of Fury]]'' (1972) which broke the box office records set previously by ''The Big Boss''. Having finished his initial two-year contract, Lee negotiated a new deal with Golden Harvest. Lee later formed his own company, ''[[Concord Production Inc.|Concord Production Inc. (協和電影公司)]]'', with Chow. For his third film, ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'' (1972), he was given complete control of the film's production as the writer, director, star, and [[Stage combat|choreographer]] of the fight scenes.

In 1964, at a demonstration in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], California, Lee had met [[Karate]] champion Chuck Norris. In ''Way of the Dragon'' Lee introduced Norris to movie-goers as his opponent in the final death fight at the [[Colosseum]] in Rome, today considered one of Lee's most legendary fight scenes and one of the most memorable fight scenes in [[martial arts film]] history.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|1989|}}</ref> The role was originally offered to American Karate champion [[Joe Lewis (martial artist)|Joe Lewis]].<ref>Thomas, B.

[[File:Avenue of Stars Bruce Lee.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Bruce Lee's star at the [[Avenue of Stars, Hong Kong]].]]
In late 1972, Lee began work on his fourth Golden Harvest Film, ''[[Game of Death]]''. He began filming some scenes including his fight sequence with 7′2″ American Basketball star [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], a former student. Production was stopped when Warner Brothers offered Lee the opportunity to star in ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'', the first film to be produced jointly by Golden Harvest and Warner Bros. Filming commenced in Hong Kong in February 1973. One month into the filming, another production company, Starseas Motion Pictures, promoted Bruce Lee as a leading actor in ''Fist of Unicorn'', although he had merely agreed to choreograph the fight sequences in the film as a favour to his long-time friend [[Unicorn Chan]]. Lee planned to sue the production company, but retained his friendship with Chan.<ref name="Thomas, B. 2003">Thomas, B. (2003) Bruce Lee Fighting Words. Berkeley: Frog Ltd.</ref> However, only a few months after the completion of ''Enter the Dragon'', and six days before its July 26, 1973 release,<ref>{{IMDb title|0070034|Enter the Dragon}}</ref> Lee died. ''Enter the Dragon'' would go on to become one of the year's highest grossing films and cement Lee as a martial arts legend. It was made for US$850,000 in 1973 (equivalent to $4&nbsp;million adjusted for inflation as of 2007).<ref name=bls>{{cite web|accessdate=May 30, 2008|url=http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl|title=Inflation Calculator|publisher=[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]}}</ref> To date, ''Enter the Dragon'' has grossed over $200&nbsp;million worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,991260-3,00.html|title=The Gladiator BRUCE LEE|last=Stein|first=Joel|work=TIME |date=June 14, 1999|page=3|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> The film sparked a brief [[Fads and trends|fad]] in martial arts, epitomised in songs such as "[[Kung Fu Fighting]]" and TV shows like ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]''.

[[Robert Clouse]], the director of ''Enter the Dragon'' and Golden Harvest revived Lee's unfinished film ''Game of Death''. Lee had shot over 100 minutes of footage, including out-takes, for ''Game of Death'' before shooting was stopped to allow him to work on ''Enter the Dragon''. In addition to [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Abdul-Jabbar]], [[George Lazenby]], Hapkido master [[Ji Han-Jae]] and another of Lee's students, [[Dan Inosanto]], were also to appear in the film, which was to culminate in Lee's character, Hai Tien (clad in the now-famous yellow track suit) taking on a series of different challengers on each floor as they make their way through a five-level pagoda. In a controversial move, Robert Clouse finished the film using a [[look-alike]] and [[stock footage|archive footage]] of Lee from his other films with a new storyline and cast, which was released in 1978. However, the cobbled-together film contained only fifteen minutes of actual footage of Lee (he had printed many unsuccessful takes)<ref>''Bruce Lee, the Legend'', 1977, Paragon Films, Ltd., [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]</ref> while the rest had a Lee look-alike, [[Kim Tai Chung]], and [[Yuen Biao]] as stunt double. The unused footage Lee had filmed was recovered 22 years later and included in the documentary ''[[Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0297814|title=Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey}}</ref>
[[File:Bruce Lee Walk of fame.jpg|thumb|left|Bruce Lee's star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]]]
Apart from ''[[Game of Death]]'', other future film projects were planned to feature Lee at the time. In 1972, after the success of ''[[The Big Boss]]'' and ''[[Fist of Fury]]'', a third film was planned by [[Raymond Chow]] at [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]] to be directed by [[Lo Wei]], titled ''Yellow-Faced Tiger''. However, at the time, Lee decided to direct and produce his own script for ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'' instead. Although Lee had formed a production company with Raymond Chow, a period film was also planned from September–November 1973 with the competing [[Shaw Brothers Studio]], to be directed by either [[Chor Yuen]] or Cheng Kang, and written by Yi Kang and [[Chang Cheh]], titled ''The Seven Sons of the Jade Dragon''.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=January 6, 2011|url=http://www.fortunecity.com/lavender/friday/155/id47.htm|title=Shaw Brothers Film Project}}</ref> Lee had also worked on several scripts himself. A tape containing a recording of Lee narrating the basic storyline to a film tentatively titled ''Southern Fist/Northern Leg'' exists, showing some similarities with the canned script for ''The Silent Flute'' (''[[Circle of Iron]]'').<ref>Bruce Lee The Man & The Legend (Documentary, Golden Harvest, 1973)</ref> Another script had the title ''Green Bamboo Warrior'', set in San Francisco, planned to co-star [[Bolo Yeung]] and to be produced by [[Andrew Vajna]] who later went on to produce ''[[First Blood]]''.<ref name="Thomas, B. 2003"/> Photo shoot costume tests were also organized for some of these planned film projects.

==Artistry==

===Philosophy===
Lee is best known as a martial artist, but he also studied drama and philosophy while a student at the [[University of Washington]]. He was well-read and had an extensive library. His own books on martial arts and fighting philosophy are known for their philosophical assertions, both inside and outside of martial arts circles. His [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] philosophy often mirrored his fighting beliefs, though he was quick to claim that his martial arts were solely a metaphor for such teachings. He believed that any knowledge ultimately led to self-knowledge, and said that his chosen method of self-expression was martial arts.<ref name="warriorwithin122"/> His influences include [[Taoism]], [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], and [[Buddhism]].<ref>[[Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey]] at 31m45s</ref> On the other hand, Lee's philosophy was very much in opposition to the conservative worldview advocated by [[Confucianism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bolelli|2008|p=161}}</ref> John Little states that Lee was an [[Atheism|atheist]]. When asked in 1972 about his religious affiliation, he replied, "none whatsoever".<ref name="warriorwithin128">{{harvnb|Little|1996|p=128}}</ref> In 1972, he was asked if he believed in God, and responded, "To be perfectly frank, I really do not".<ref name="warriorwithin122">{{harvnb|Little|1996|p=122}}</ref>

===Poetry===
Aside from [[martial arts]] and [[philosophy]] which focus on the physical aspect and self-consciousness for truths and principles,<ref>{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Bruce|title=The Warrior Within|year=1996|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Martial arts-Philosophy|isbn=0-8092-3194-8|editor=John Little}}</ref> Lee also wrote poetry that reflected his emotion and a stage in his life collectively.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Bruce|title=Bruce Lee Artist of Life|year=1999|publisher=Tuttle|isbn=978-0-8048-3263-2|pages=93–116|author2=Linda Lee Cadwell|editor=John Little|type=Book}}</ref> Many forms of art remain concordant with the artist creating them. Lee's principal of self-expression was applied to his poetry as well. His daughter Shannon Lee said "He did write poetry, he was really the consummate artist".<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Shannon|title=Bruce Lee's Poetry: Shannon Lee reads one of her father's handwritten poems|url=http://www.brucelee.com/index.cfm/page/Bruce-Lee-s-Poetry---Shannon-Lee-reads-one-of-her-father-s-handwritten-poems/pid/10277/cdid/10363|work=Poetry|accessdate=April 17, 2012}}</ref> His poetic works originally handwritten on paper, later on edited and published. John Little being the major author (editor), for Bruce Lee's works. Linda Lee Cadwell (Bruce Lee's wife) shared her husbands notes, poems and experiences with followers. She mentioned "Lee's poems are, by American standards, rather dark-reflecting the deeper, less exposed recesses of the human psyche".<ref>{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Bruce|title=Bruce Lee Artist of Life|year=1999|publisher=Tuttle|location=Martial Arts|isbn=978-0-8048-3263-2|page=92|author2=Linda Lee Cadwell|editor=John Little|type=Book|chapter=Part 4 Poetry}}</ref> Most of Bruce Lee's poems are categorized as [[anti-poetry]] or fall into a [[paradox]]. The mood in his poems show the side of the man that can be compared with other poets such as [[Robert Frost]], one of many well-known poets expressing himself with dark poetic works. The paradox taken from the [[Yin and Yang]] symbol in martial arts, also integrated in his poetry. His martial arts, and philosophy contribute a great part to his poetry. The [[free verse]] form of Lee's poetry reflect his famous quote "Be formless&nbsp;... shapeless, like water."<ref>{{cite book|title=The Warrior Within|year=1996|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Martial arts-Philosophy|isbn=0-8092-3194-8|page=43|author=John Little|editor=John Little|type=Book|chapter=Five: The Running Water}}</ref>

==Death==
[[File:Bruce Lee 1.JPG|thumb|Bruce Lee is buried next to his son [[Brandon Lee|Brandon]] in [[Lake View Cemetery (Seattle)|Lakeview Cemetery, Seattle]].]] 
On May 10, 1973, Lee collapsed during an [[Dubbing_(filmmaking)#ADR.2Fpost-sync|ADR]] session for ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' at [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]] in Hong Kong. Suffering from [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]] and headaches, he was immediately rushed to [[Hong Kong Baptist Hospital]] where doctors diagnosed [[cerebral edema]]. They were able to reduce the swelling through the administration of [[mannitol]]. The headache and cerebral edema that occurred in his first collapse were later repeated on the day of his death.<ref name="collapse">{{harvnb|Thomas|1994}}</ref>

On July 20, 1973, Lee was in Hong Kong, to have dinner with [[James Bond]] star [[George Lazenby]], with whom he intended to make a film. According to Lee's wife Linda, Lee met producer [[Raymond Chow]] at 2&nbsp;p.m. at home to discuss the making of the film ''[[Game of Death]]''. They worked until 4&nbsp;p.m. and then drove together to the home of Lee's colleague [[Betty Ting Pei]], a [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] actress. The three went over the script at Ting's home, and then Chow left to attend a dinner meeting.<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2006|p=205}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lee|1989|pp=156–157}}</ref>

Later Lee complained of a headache, and Ting gave him an [[analgesic]] (painkiller), [[Equagesic]], which contained both [[aspirin]] and the tranquilizer [[meprobamate]]. Around 7:30&nbsp;p.m., he went to lie down for a nap. When Lee did not turn up for dinner, producer Raymond Chow came to the apartment, but was unable to wake Lee up. A doctor was summoned, who spent ten minutes attempting to revive Lee before sending him by ambulance to [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong|Queen Elizabeth Hospital]]. By the time he reached the hospital, Lee died at the age of 32.  

There was no visible external injury; however, according to autopsy reports, Lee's [[Human brain|brain]] had swollen considerably, from 1,400 to 1,575 grams (a 13% increase). The autopsy found Equagesic in his system. On October 15, 2005, Chow stated in an interview that Lee died from an [[allergic reaction]] to the tranquilizer meprobamate, the main ingredient in Equagesic, which Chow described as an ingredient commonly used in painkillers. When the doctors announced Lee's death officially, it was ruled a "[[death by misadventure]]".<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2006|p=206}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/02/26/stories/2006022605431400.htm |title=Bruce Lee died of seizure? |work=The Hindu |location=India |date=February 26, 2006 |accessdate=June 3, 2011}}</ref>

Lee's wife Linda returned to her hometown of [[Seattle]], and had him buried at lot 276 of [[Lake View Cemetery (Seattle)|Lakeview Cemetery]].<ref name=Lakeview>[http://www.lakeviewcemeteryassociation.com/burials.php Lakeview Cemetery website.] Search for Lee. Only use last name.</ref> Pallbearers at his funeral on July 31, 1973 included [[Taky Kimura]], [[Steve McQueen]], [[James Coburn]], [[Chuck Norris]], [[George Lazenby]], [[Dan Inosanto]], Peter Chin, and Lee's brother [[Robert Lee (musician)|Robert]].

===Controversy surrounding Lee's death===
Around the time of Lee's death, numerous rumors appeared in the media.<ref name=shih>{{cite news|last1=SHIH|first1=LEE HAN|title=The Life of the Dragon|url=http://www.theasiamag.com/cheat-sheet/the-life-of-the-dragon|accessdate=Jun 1, 2009|agency=asia! Magazine|issue=*Special to asia!|publisher=Lee Han Shih is the founder, publisher and editor of asia! Magazine.}}</ref> Lee's [[Cultural icon|iconic status]] and untimely demise fed many wild rumors and theories. These included murder involving the [[Triad (underground society)|Triads]] and a supposed curse on him and his family.<ref>{{harvnb|Bishop|2004|p=157}}</ref> There is also a theory that Bruce Lee used [[electrical muscle stimulation]] and that may have exacerbated or resulted in his condition.{{cn|date=March 2015}}

[[Donald Teare]], a [[Forensic science|forensic scientist]] recommended by [[Scotland Yard]] who had overseen over 1,000 autopsies, was assigned to the Lee case. His conclusion was "[[death by misadventure]]" caused by an acute cerebral edema due to a reaction to compounds present in the combination medication Equagesic.<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|1994|p=209}}</ref>

Dr. Donald Langford, a Baptist missionary and Lee’s doctor in Hong Kong, has said, "Nobody dies from one tablet of Equagesic. No analgesic killed Bruce."<ref name=shih /> He added: "[P]eople weren't about to step up and say Bruce Lee had died from eating [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] [which was found in his stomach, and which he had consumed regularly for some time due to the stress of his fame] or some related product. At the beginning of the inquest proceedings, Dr. Wu and a couple of other doctors and I were pulled to the side and asked to play down the role of cannabis in Bruce’s death."<ref name=shih />

The preliminary opinion of Dr. Peter Wu, the [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]] who treated Lee during his first seizure in May 1973, was that the cause of death should have been attributed to either a reaction to cannabis or Equagesic. He has stated that "We removed quite a lot of [[hashish]] from his stomach [in May]. In Nepal there have been all kinds of neurological problems associated with hashish, especially cerebral edema."<ref name=shih /> However, Wu officially backed off from his position, officially stating that:

{{quote|Professor Teare was a forensic scientist recommended by Scotland Yard; he was brought in as an expert on cannabis and we can't contradict his testimony. The dosage of cannabis is neither precise nor predictable, but I've never known of anyone dying simply from taking it.<ref name="Thomas 1994 p=228">{{harvnb|Thomas|1994|p=228}}</ref>}}

At the 1975 San Diego Comic-Con convention, Bruce Lee's friend [[Chuck Norris]] attributed his death to a reaction between the muscle-relaxant medication he had been taking since 1968 for a ruptured disk in his back, and an "[[antibiotic]]" he was given for his headache on the night of his death.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ekAQfN8x8 Chuck Norris Explains What Really Killed Bruce Lee At The 1975 San Diego Comic-Con Convention]</ref>

The book ''The Death of Bruce Lee: A Clinical Investigation'' presents the belief that Bruce Lee was already "sensitized" to the use of Equagesic by the time of his first "acute hypersensitivity reaction" on May 10, 1973.  Lee refrained from using the drug again until that fateful evening of July 20, 1973, when he took Equagesic and later died of cerebral edema.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McKenzie R.N.|first1=Duncan Alexander|title=The Death of Bruce Lee: A Clinical Investigation|date=2012|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781300108863|pages=42–45; 100–105}}</ref>

==Legacy==

===Certified instructors===
Bruce Lee personally certified only three instructors: [[Taky Kimura]], [[James Yimm Lee]], and [[Dan Inosanto]]. Inosanto holds the 3rd rank (Instructor) directly from Bruce Lee in Jeet Kune Do, Jun Fan Gung Fu, and Bruce Lee's Tao of Chinese Gung Fu. [[Taky Kimura]] holds a 5th rank in Jun Fan Gung Fu. James Yimm Lee held a 3rd rank in Jun Fan Gung Fu. Ted Wong holds 2nd rank in Jeet Kune Do certified directly by Bruce Lee and was later promoted to Instructor under Dan Inosanto, who felt that Bruce would have wanted to promote him. Other Jeet Kune Do instructors since Lee's death have been certified directly by Dan Inosanto, some with remaining Bruce Lee signed certificates.

James Yimm Lee, a close friend of Lee, certified a few students including Gary Dill who studied Jeet Kune Do under James and received permission via a personal letter from him in 1972 to pass on his learning of Jun Fan Gung Fu to others. [[Taky Kimura]], to date, has certified only one person in Jun Fan Gung Fu: his son Andy Kimura. Dan Inosanto continued to teach and certify select students in [[Jeet Kune Do]] for over 30 years, making it possible for thousands of martial arts practitioners to trace their training lineage back to Bruce Lee. Prior to his death, Lee told his then only two living instructors Kimura and Inosanto (James Yimm Lee had died in 1972) to dismantle his schools.

Both [[Taky Kimura]] and Dan Inosanto were allowed to teach small classes thereafter, under the guideline "keep the numbers low, but the quality high". Bruce also instructed several World Karate Champions including Chuck Norris, [[Joe Lewis (martial artist)|Joe Lewis]], and Mike Stone. Among the three of them, during their training with Bruce they won every karate championship in the United States.<ref>{{harvnb|Little|2001|p=211}}</ref>

In Japan, Junichi Okada is a certified Japanese instructor in Jeet Kune Do.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyohive.com/2010/09/v6-okada-junichi-now-a-martial-arts-instructor/|title=V6 Okada Junichi now a martial arts instructor|accessdate=January 15, 2012|date=September 10, 2010|publisher=Tokyo Hive}}</ref>

===Hong Kong legacy===
[[File:Hong kong bruce lee statue.jpg|thumb|[[Bruce Lee statue in Hong Kong]]]]
There are a number of stories (perhaps [[apocrypha]]l) surrounding Lee that are still repeated in [[Culture of Hong Kong|Hong Kong culture]]. One is that his early 1970s interview on the [[TVB]] show ''[[Enjoy Yourself Tonight]]'' cleared the busy streets of Hong Kong as everyone was watching the interview at home.

On January 6, 2009, it was announced that Bruce's Hong Kong home (41 Cumberland Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong) will be preserved and transformed into a tourist site by philanthropist Yu Pang-lin.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i7b57851228481ca584da06e5f92020f5|title=Bruce Lee's home to become a museum|date=January 6, 2009|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=August 28, 2010|deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/07/19/stories/2008071956432000.htm |title=Bruce Lee 35th anniversary |work=The Hindu |location=India |date=July 19, 2008 |accessdate=June 3, 2011}}</ref>
