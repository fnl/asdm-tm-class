'''Audie Leon Murphy''' (20 June 1925 – 28 May 1971)<!-- LEAVE THIS ALONE! See [[Audie Murphy]] talk page: Archive #1 §22--> was one of the most decorated American combat soldiers of [[World War II]],<!-- LEAVE THIS ALONE! Do not change to "most decorated". Do not edit war over this wording. See [[Audie Murphy]] talk page: discussions on all talk page archives, all reviews.  --> receiving every military combat award for valor available from the [[U.S. Army]], as well as French and Belgian awards for heroism. At the age of 19, Murphy received the [[Medal of Honor]] after single-handedly holding off an entire company of German soldiers for an hour at the [[Colmar Pocket]] in France in January 1945, then leading a successful counterattack while wounded and out of ammunition.

Murphy was born into a large [[sharecropper]] family in [[Hunt County, Texas]]. His father abandoned them, and his mother died when he was a teenager. Murphy left school in fifth grade to pick [[cotton]] and find other work to help support his family; his skill with a hunting rifle was a necessity for putting food on the table. Murphy's older sister helped him to falsify documentation about his birth date to meet the minimum-age requirement for enlisting in the military, and after being turned down by the [[United States Navy|Navy]] and the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] he enlisted in the Army. He first saw action in the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] and the [[Battle of Anzio]], and in 1944 was part of the [[liberation of Rome]] and [[Operation Dragoon|invasion of southern France]]. Murphy fought at [[Montélimar]], and led his men on a successful assault at the L'Omet quarry near [[Cleurie]] in northeastern France in October.

After the war Murphy enjoyed a 21-year acting career. He played himself in the 1955 autobiographical ''[[To Hell and Back (film)|To Hell and Back]]'' based on his 1949 memoirs of the same name, but most of his films were [[Western (genre)|western]]s. He made guest appearances on celebrity television shows and starred in the series ''[[Whispering Smith (TV series)|Whispering Smith]]''. Murphy was a fairly accomplished songwriter, and bred [[American Quarter Horse|quarter horses]] in California and Arizona, becoming a regular participant in horse racing.

Suffering from what would today be termed [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), he slept with a loaded handgun under his pillow and looked for solace in addictive sleeping pills. In the last few years of his life he was plagued by money problems, but refused offers to appear in alcohol and cigarette commercials because he did not want to set a bad example. Murphy died in a plane crash in Virginia in 1971 shortly before his 46th birthday, and was interred with full military honors at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

==Early life==

Audie Leon Murphy was born the seventh of twelve children to Emmett Berry Murphy and his wife Josie Bell Killian on 20 June 1925, in [[Kingston, Texas|Kingston]], Hunt County, Texas.{{refn|group=ALM|name=birth|Murphy's son Terry is the President of the Audie Murphy Research Foundation, which in both its biographical sketch and Murphy Family Tree list his year of birth as 1925.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Audie L. Murphy Memorial Website|title=BIOGRAPHY A short biographical sketch|url=http://www.audiemurphy.com/biography.htm|accessdate=12 October 2013}}</ref> Murphy's date of birth has been given as both 1925 and 1924 by Murphy himself. He seemed to go back and forth on the dates for the rest of his life. His sister Corrine Burns as his nearest living kin signed a notarized document attesting to the birth date of 20 June 1924 that Murphy put on his enlistment application, falsifying his year of birth in order to make him appear old enough to meet the U.S. Army age qualification for enlistment. Subsequently, all military records show the falsified date as his birth date.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Audie L. Murphy Memorial Website|title=Scan of original Application for Degrees, N.

As a child, Murphy was a loner with mood swings and an explosive temper.{{sfn|Murphy|2002|pp=4–7}} He grew up in Texas, around [[Farmersville, Texas|Farmersville]], [[Greenville, Texas|Greenville]], and [[Celeste, Texas|Celeste]], where he attended elementary school.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Texas Historical Commission|title=Celeste, Texas|url=http://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/viewform.asp?atlas_num=5231007820&site_name=Murphy%2C%20Audie&class=5000|accessdate=12 October 2013}}</ref> His father drifted in and out of the family's life and eventually deserted them. Murphy dropped out of school in fifth grade and got a job picking cotton for a dollar a day to help support his family; he also became skilled with a rifle, hunting small game to help feed them. After his mother died of [[endocarditis]] and [[pneumonia]]{{sfn|Simpson|1975|p=28}} in 1941, he worked at a radio repair shop and at a combination general store, garage and gas station in Greenville.{{sfn|Murphy|2002|p=7}} Hunt County authorities placed his three youngest siblings in Boles Children's Home,<ref>{{cite web|last=Minor|first=David|title=Boles Home|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ynb02|work=Handbook of Texas Online|accessdate=12 October 2013}}</ref> a Christian orphanage in [[Quinlan, Texas|Quinlan]]. After the war, he bought a house in Farmersville for his oldest sister Corrine and her husband Poland Burns. His other siblings briefly shared the home.{{sfn|Tate|2006|pp=152–163}}

The loss of his mother stayed with Murphy throughout his life.  He later stated:

{{quote|She died when I was sixteen. She had the most beautiful hair I've ever seen. It reached almost to the floor. She rarely talked; and always seemed to be searching for something. What it was I don't know. We didn't discuss our feelings. But when she passed away, she took something of me with her. It seems I've been searching for it ever since.{{sfn|Murphy|2002|p=143}}}}

==World War II service==
{{main|Military career of Audie Murphy}}

Murphy had always wanted to be a soldier, and after the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941, he tried to enlist,{{sfn|Murphy|2002|p=7}} but the Army, Navy and Marine Corps all turned him down for being underweight and underage. After his sister provided an [[affidavit]] falsifying his birth date by a year, he was accepted by the U.S. Army on 30 June 1942.{{refn|group=ALM| name=birth}}{{refn|group=ALM|name=weight|Conflicting information exists as to Murphy's date and place of enlistment. The Audie L. Murphy Memorial website has scanned documents from the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration that include Corrinne Burns' statement and Murphy's "Induction Record", which shows him "Enlisted at Dallas, Texas" on 30 June 1942, and the line above it says "Accepted for service at Greenville, Texas". The National Register of Historic Places Listing added the Greenville post office as historic site number 74002081 in 1974, citing it as Murphy's place of enlistment, possibly referring to the act the military termed "Accepted for service". The NRHP also shows his enlistment date as 20 June 1942 which might be the date he was accepted for service.{{sfn|Tate|2006|pp=152–163}}<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Audie L.

==Song writing==
{{Main|List of songs written by Audie Murphy}}
David "Spec" McClure, his collaborator on the book ''To Hell and Back'', discovered Murphy's talent for poetry during their work on the memoir when he found discarded verses in Murphy's Hollywood apartment. One of those poems, "The Crosses Grow on Anzio", appears in ''To Hell and Back'' attributed to a soldier named Kerrigan.{{sfn|Simpson|1975|p=374}} Only two others survived, "Alone and Far Removed" {{sfn|Simpson|1975|p=374}} and "Freedom Flies in Your Heart Like an Eagle". The latter was part of a speech Murphy had written at a 1968 dedication of the Alabama War Memorial in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], and later set to music by Scott Turner under the title "Dusty Old Helmet".{{sfn|Simpson|1975|pp=374–376}}

Murphy was a fan of country music, in particular [[Bob Wills]] and [[Chet Atkins]], but was not a singer or musician himself.{{sfn|Simpson|1975|pp=371, 373}} Through his friend [[Guy Mitchell]],  a recording artist, he was introduced to songwriter [[Scott Turner (songwriter)|Scott Turner]] sometime in the 1940s.{{sfn|Graham|1989|p=298}} The three of them collaborated on numerous songs between 1962 and 1970, the most successful being "Shutters and Boards" and  "When the Wind Blows in Chicago".{{sfn|Simpson|1975|p=372}}
