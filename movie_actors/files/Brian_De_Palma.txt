'''Brian Russell De Palma''' (born September 11, 1940) is an American film director and screenwriter. In a career spanning over 40 years, he is probably best known for his suspense and crime [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] films. He directed successful and popular films such as ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'', ''[[Dressed to Kill (1980 film)|Dressed to Kill]]'', ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'', ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'', ''[[Carlito's Way]]'' and ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]''.

==Early life==
De Palma, who is of Italian ancestry, was born in [[Newark, New Jersey]], the son of Vivienne (née Muti) and [[Anthony DePalma|Anthony Federico De Palma]], an [[orthopedic]] surgeon.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/80/Brian-De-Palma.html "Brian De Palma Biography (1940–)"]. Film Reference. Retrieved 2012-01-14.</ref> He was raised in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania and [[New Hampshire]] and attended various [[Protestant]] and [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] schools, eventually graduating from [[Friends' Central School]]. When he was in high school, he built computers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/brian-de-palma-talks-about-his-stylish-new-remake--102271 |title=Brian De Palma talks about his stylish new remake, Passion |publisher=A.V.

==1960s and early career==
Enrolled at [[Columbia University|Columbia]] as a physics student, De Palma became enraptured with the filmmaking process after viewing ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' and ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''. De Palma subsequently enrolled at the newly coed [[Sarah Lawrence College]] as a graduate student in their theater department in the early 1960s, becoming one of the first male students among a female population. Once there, influences as various as drama teacher [[Wilford Leach]], the [[Albert and David Maysles|Maysles brothers]], [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Alfred Hitchcock]] impressed upon De Palma the many styles and themes that would shape his own cinema in the coming decades. An early association with a young [[Robert De Niro]] resulted in ''[[The Wedding Party (film)|The Wedding Party]]''. The film, which was co-directed with Leach and producer Cynthia Munroe, had been shot in 1963 but remained unreleased until 1969, when De Palma's star had risen sufficiently within the [[Greenwich Village]] filmmaking scene. De Niro was unknown at the time; the credits mistakenly display his name as "Robert {{sic|hide=y|Den|ero}}." The film is noteworthy for its invocation of silent film techniques and an insistence on the [[jump-cut]] for effect. De Palma followed this with various small films for the [[NAACP]] and The [[U.S. Treasury Department|Treasury Department]].

During the 1960s, De Palma began making a living producing documentary films, notably ''The Responsive Eye'', a 1966 movie about ''[[The Responsive Eye]]'' [[op-art]] exhibit curated by William Seitz for [[MOMA|Museum of Modern Art]] in 1965. In an interview with Gelmis from 1969, De Palma described the film as "very good and very successful. It's distributed by Pathe Contemporary and makes lots of money. I shot it in four hours, with synched sound. I had two other guys shooting people's reactions to the paintings, and the paintings themselves."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gelmis |first=Joseph |authorlink= |title=The Film Director as Superstar |year=1970 |publisher=Doubleday & Company, Inc. |location=Garden City |page=24}}</ref>

''[[Dionysus (film)|Dionysus in 69]]'' (1969) was De Palma's other major documentary from this period. The film records [[The Performance Group]]'s performance of Euripides' [[The Bacchae]], starring, amongst others, De Palma regular William Finley. The play is noted for breaking traditional barriers between performers and audience. The film's most striking quality is its extensive use of the [[split screen (film)|split-screen]]. De Palma recalls that he was "floored" by this performance upon first sight, and in 1973 recounts how he "began to try and figure out a way to capture it on film. I came up with the idea of split-screen, to be able to show the actual audience involvement, to trace the life of the audience and that of the play as they merge in and out of each other."<ref>{{cite book|last= Knapp |first=Lawrence |title=Brian De Palma Interviews |year=2003 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |location=Jackson |page=26}}</ref>

De Palma's most significant features from this decade are ''[[Greetings (1968 film)|Greetings]]'' (1968) and ''[[Hi, Mom!]]'' (1970). Both films star Robert De Niro and espouse a [[Leftist]] [[revolutionary]] viewpoint common to their era. ''Greetings'' was entered into the [[19th Berlin International Film Festival]], where it won a [[Silver Bear]] award.<ref name="berlinale 1969">{{Cite web|title=Berlinale 1969: Prize Winners |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1969/03_preistr_ger_1969/03_Preistraeger_1969.html |accessdate=March 6, 2010 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> His other major film from this period is the slasher comedy ''[[Murder a la Mod]]''. Each of these films contains experiments in narrative and [[intertextuality]], reflecting De Palma's stated intention to become the "American [[Jean-Luc Godard|Godard]]" while integrating several of the themes which permeated Hitchcock's work.<ref>Brody, Richard. ''Everything Is Cinema: The Working Life of Jean-Luc Godard''. p. 323.</ref>

''Greetings'' is about three New Yorkers dealing with the draft. The film is often considered the first to deal explicitly with the draft. The film is noteworthy for its use of various experimental techniques to convey its narrative in ultimately unconventional ways. Footage was sped up, rapid cutting was used to distance the audience from the narrative, and it was difficult to discern with whom the audience must ultimately align. "Greetings" ultimately grossed over $1 million at the box office and cemented De Palma's position as a bankable filmmaker.

After the success of his 1968 breakthrough, De Palma and his producing partner, Charles Hirsch, were given the opportunity by Sigma 3 to make an unofficial sequel of sorts, initially entitled ''Son of Greetings'', and subsequently released as ''Hi, Mom!''. While "Greetings" accentuated its varied cast, ''Hi, Mom!'' focuses on De Niro's character, Jon Rubin, an essential carry-over from the previous film. The film is ultimately significant insofar as it displays the first enunciation of De Palma's style in all its major traits – voyeurism, guilt, and a hyper-consciousness of the medium are all on full display, not just as hallmarks, but built into this formal, material apparatus itself.

These traits come to the fore in ''Hi, Mom!'''s "[[Be Black, Baby]]" sequence. This sequence parodies [[cinéma vérité]], the dominant documentary tradition of the 1960s, while simultaneously providing the audience with a visceral and disturbingly emotional experience. De Palma describes the sequence as a constant invocation of [[Brecht]]ian distanciation: “First of all, I am interested in the medium of film itself, and I am constantly standing outside and making people aware that they are always watching a film. At the same time I am evolving it. In ''Hi, Mom!'' for instance, there is a sequence where you are obviously watching a ridiculous documentary and you are told that and you are aware of it, but it still sucks you in. There is a kind of Brechtian alienation idea here: you are aware of what you are watching at the same time that you are emotionally involved with it.”

"Be Black, Baby" was filmed in black and white stock on 16&nbsp;mm, in low-light conditions that stress the crudity of the direct cinema aesthetic. It is precisely from this crudity that the film itself gains a credibility of “realism.” In an interview with Michael Bliss, De Palma notes “[Be Black, Baby] was rehearsed for almost three weeks... In fact, it's all scripted. But once the thing starts, they just go with the way it's going. I specifically got a very good documentary camera filmmaker (Robert Elfstrom) to just shoot it like a documentary to follow the action." Furthermore, "I wanted to show in ''Hi, Mom!'' how you can really involve an audience. You take an absurd premise – "Be Black, Baby" – and totally involve them and really frighten them at the same time. It's very Brechtian. You suck 'em in and annihilate 'em. Then you say, "It's just a movie, right? It's not real." It's just like television. You're sucked in all the time, and you're being lied to in a very documentary-like setting. The "Be Black, Baby" section of ''Hi, Mom!'' is probably the most important piece of film I've ever done."

==Transition to Hollywood==
In the 1970s, De Palma went to Hollywood where he worked on bigger budget films. In 1970, De Palma left New York for Hollywood at age thirty to make ''[[Get to Know Your Rabbit]]'', starring Orson Welles and Tommy Smothers. Making the film was a crushing experience for De Palma as Tommy Smothers didn't like a lot of De Palma's ideas.<ref name=Salamon26>Salamon, p. 26.</ref>

After several small, studio and independent released films that included stand-outs ''[[Sisters (1973 film)|Sisters]]'', ''[[Phantom of the Paradise]]'', and ''[[Obsession (1976 film)|Obsession]]'', a small film based on a novel called ''Carrie'' was released directed by Brian De Palma. The [[psychic]] thriller ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'' is seen by some as De Palma's bid for a blockbuster. In fact, the project was small, underfunded by [[United Artists]], and well under the cultural radar during the early months of production, as [[Stephen King]]'s source novel had yet to climb the bestseller list. De Palma gravitated toward the project and changed crucial plot elements based upon his own predilections, not the saleability of the novel. The cast was young and relatively new, though the stars [[Sissy Spacek]] and [[John Travolta]] had gained considerable attention for previous work in, respectively, film and episodic [[situation comedy|sitcoms]]. ''Carrie'' became a hit, the first genuine box-office success for De Palma. It garnered Spacek and [[Piper Laurie]] Oscar nominations for their performances. Preproduction for the film had coincided with the casting process for [[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'', and many of the actors cast in De Palma's film had been earmarked as contenders for Lucas's movie, and vice versa.<ref>{{Cite web|accessdate=December 4, 2011 |url=http://www.life.com/gallery/61531/image/2661928/almost-cast-who-lost-iconic-roles#index/53 |title=Almost Cast: Who Lost Iconic Roles? |publisher=''Life'' |year=}}</ref> The "shock ending" finale is effective even while it upholds horror-film convention, its suspense sequences are buttressed by teen comedy tropes, and its use of [[split screen (film)|split-screen]], split-diopter and [[slow motion]] shots tell the story visually rather than through dialogue.

The financial and critical success of ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'' allowed De Palma to pursue more personal material. ''[[The Demolished Man]]'' was a novel that had fascinated De Palma since the late 1950s and appealed to his background in mathematics and [[avant-garde]] storytelling. Its unconventional unfolding of plot (exemplified in its mathematical layout of dialogue) and its stress on perception have analogs in De Palma's filmmaking. He sought to adapt it on numerous occasions, though the project would carry a substantial price tag, and has yet to appear onscreen (Steven Spielberg's adaptation of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' bears striking similarities to De Palma's visual style and some of the themes of ''The Demolished Man''). The result of his experience with adapting ''The Demolished Man'' was ''[[The Fury (1978 film)|The Fury]]'', a science fiction psychic thriller that starred [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Carrie Snodgress]], [[John Cassavetes]] and [[Amy Irving]]. The film was admired by [[Jean-Luc Godard]], who featured a clip in his mammoth [[Histoire(s) du cinéma]], and [[Pauline Kael]] who championed both ''The Fury'' and De Palma. The film boasted a larger budget than ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'', though the consensus view at the time was that De Palma was repeating himself, with diminishing returns. As a film it retains De Palma's considerable visual flair, but points more toward his work in mainstream entertainments such as ''[[The Untouchables (1987 film)|The Untouchables]]'' and ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'', the thematic complex thrillers for which he is now better known.

For many film-goers, De Palma's gangster films, most notably ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' and ''[[Carlito's Way]]'', pushed the envelope of violence and depravity, and yet greatly vary from one another in both style and content and also illustrate De Palma's evolution as a film-maker. In essence, the excesses of ''Scarface'' contrast with the more emotional tragedy of ''Carlito's Way''. Both films feature Al Pacino in what has become a fruitful working relationship. In 1984, he directed the music video of Bruce Springsteen's song "Dancing in the Dark".

Later into the 1990s and 2000s, De Palma did other films. He attempted to do dramas and a few thrillers plus science fiction. Some of these movies (''Mission: Impossible, Carlito's Way'') worked and some others (''Mission to Mars, Raising Cain, Snake Eyes, The Bonfire of the Vanities'') failed at the box office. Of these films, ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities (film)|The Bonfire of the Vanities]]'' would be De Palma's biggest box office disaster, losing millions. Another later movie from De Palma, ''[[Redacted (film)|Redacted]]'', unleashed a controversy over its subject of American involvement in [[Iraq]], and supposed atrocities committed there. It received limited release in the United States.

In 2012, his film ''[[Passion (2012 film)|Passion]]'' was selected to compete for the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[69th Venice International Film Festival]].<ref name="labiennale">{{cite web|url=http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/festival/lineup/off-sel/venezia69/ |title=Venezia 69 |accessdate=July 28, 2012 |work=labiennale}}</ref>

==Trademarks and style==

===Themes===
De Palma's films can fall into two categories, his [[psychological thriller]]s (''Sisters'', ''Body Double'', ''Obsession'', ''Dressed to Kill'', ''Blow Out'', ''Raising Cain'') and his mainly commercial films (''Scarface'', ''The Untouchables'', ''Carlito's Way'', and ''Mission: Impossible''). He has often produced "De Palma" films one after the other before going on to direct a different genre, but would always return to his familiar territory. Because of the subject matter and [[graphic violence]] of some of De Palma's films, such as ''Dressed to Kill'', ''Scarface'' and ''Body Double'', they are often at the center of controversy with the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], [[Film criticism|film critics]] and the viewing public.<ref name=AVprimer/>

De Palma is known for quoting and referencing other director's work throughout his career. [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[Blowup]]'' and [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[The Conversation]]'' plots were used for the basis of ''Blow Out''. ''The Untouchables''{{'}} finale shoot out in the train station is a clear borrow from the [[Odessa]] Steps sequence in [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]''. The main plot from ''[[Rear Window]]'' was used for ''Body Double'', while it also used elements of ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''. ''Vertigo'' was also the basis for ''Obsession''. ''Dressed to Kill'' was a note-for-note homage to Hitchcock's ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', including such moments as the surprise death of the lead actress and the exposition scene by the psychiatrist at the end.<ref name=AVprimer/>

===Camera shots===
Film critics have often noted De Palma's penchant for unusual camera angles and compositions throughout his career. He often frames characters against the background using a [[Dutch angle|canted angle shot]]. [[split screen (film)|Split-screen]] techniques have been used to show two separate events happening simultaneously.<ref name=AVprimer/> To emphasize the dramatic impact of a certain scene De Palma has employed a [[Circle|360-degree]] camera [[Panning (camera)|pan]]. Slow sweeping, panning and [[tracking shot]]s are often used throughout his films, often through precisely-choreographed [[long take]]s lasting for minutes without cutting. Split focus shots, often referred to as "di-opt", are used by De Palma to emphasize the foreground person/object while simultaneously keeping a background person/object in focus. Slow-motion is frequently used in his films to increase suspense.<ref name=AVprimer/>

==Personal life==
De Palma previously dated [[Margot Kidder]] in the early 1970s. He has been married and divorced three times, to actress [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]] (1979–1983), producer [[Gale Anne Hurd]] (1991–1993), and Darnell Gregorio (1995–1997). He has one daughter from his marriage to Gale Anne Hurd, Lolita de Palma, born in 1991, and one daughter from his marriage to Darnell Gregorio, Piper De Palma, born in 1996. He resides in [[Manhattan]], [[New York]].<ref name="indiewire08-30">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/brian-de-palma-interview-transcribed?page=2 |title=Brian De Palma Q & A: 'Passion,' McAdams vs. Rapace, Sex Tools UPDATED (New Trailer) |publisher=Indie Wire |date=August 30, 2013 |first=Anne |last=Thompson |accessdate=October 26, 2014 |page=2 }}</ref>

==Legacy==
[[File:BrianDePalma09TIFF.jpg|thumb|right|De Palma at the [[2009 Toronto International Film Festival]]]]
De Palma is often cited as a leading member of the [[New Hollywood]] generation of film directors, a distinct pedigree who either emerged from film schools or are overtly cine-literate.<ref name=AVprimer>Murray, Noel; Tobias, Scott (March 10, 2011).

Retrieved 2012-02-03.</ref> His contemporaries include [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Paul Schrader]], [[John Milius]], [[George Lucas]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[John Carpenter]], and [[Ridley Scott]]. His artistry in directing and use of cinematography and suspense in several of his films has often been compared to the work of [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref name=AVprimer/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/cl-ca-depalma24sep24,0,6512079.story|title=The Director's Craft: The death-deifying De Palma|accessdate=December 26, 2007|first=Peter|last=Rainier|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] Calendar |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080325222433/http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/cl-ca-depalma24sep24,0,6512079.story |archivedate = March 25, 2008}}</ref><ref name=FemmeFataleEbert/> Psychologists have been intrigued by De Palma's fascination with pathology, by the aberrant behavior aroused in characters who find themselves manipulated by others.<ref name=Salamon27>Salamon, p. 27.</ref>

De Palma has encouraged and fostered the filmmaking careers of directors such as [[Quentin Tarantino]], [[Mark Romanek]] and [[Keith Gordon]]. Tarantino said – during interview with De Palma, that ''[[Blow Out]]'' is one of his all time favourite films, and that after watching ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' he knew how to make his own film. [[Terrence Malick]] credits seeing De Palma's early films on college campus tours as a validation of [[independent film]], and subsequently switched his attention from philosophy to filmmaking.

Critics who frequently admire De Palma's work include [[Pauline Kael]] and [[Roger Ebert]], among others. Kael wrote in her review of ''[[Blow Out]]'', "At forty, Brian De Palma has more than twenty years of moviemaking behind him, and he has been growing better and better. Each time a new film of his opens, everything he has done before seems to have been preparation for it."<ref name=KaelBO>Kael, Pauline (July 27, 1981).

Retrieved 2012-02-03. <!-- Link is to Criterion reprint of original article. --></ref> In his review of ''[[Femme Fatale (2002 film)|Femme Fatale]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] wrote about the director: "De Palma deserves more honor as a director.

Yes, there are a few failures along the way (''Snake Eyes'', ''Mission to Mars'', ''The Bonfire of the Vanities''), but look at the range here, and reflect that these movies contain treasure for those who admire the craft as well as the story, who sense the glee with which De Palma manipulates images and characters for the simple joy of being good at it. It's not just that he sometimes works in the style of Hitchcock, but that he has the nerve to."<ref name=FemmeFataleEbert>Ebert, Roger (November 6, 2002).

==Criticisms==
Julie Salamon has written that "[De Palma] was: a perverse misogynist."<ref name=Salamon27/> De Palma has responded to accusations of misogyny by saying: "I'm always attacked for having an erotic, sexist approach-- chopping up women, putting women in peril. I'm making suspense movies! What else is going to happen to them?"

David Thomson wrote in his entry for De Palma, "There is a self-conscious cunning in De Palma's work, ready to control everything except his own cruelty and indifference."<ref>Thomson, p. 257.</ref>
