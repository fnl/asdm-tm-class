==Career==

===Early career===
Fincher was employed at Korty Films as a production assistant. He moved up the ranks and became a visual-effects producer<ref name="playboy2014"/> and worked on the animated ''[[Twice Upon a Time (1983 film)|Twice Upon a Time]]'' (1983). He was later hired by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] in 1983, where he was an assistant cameraman and [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte]] photographer<ref name="playboy2014"/> and worked on productions for ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983) and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' (1984).<ref name="independent2011">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/david-fincher-awards-are-just-icing-on-the-cake-1520062.html |title=David Fincher: "Awards are just icing on the cake" |publisher=''The Independent'' |date=February 1, 2009 |first=James |last=Mottram |accessdate=October 11, 2014 }}</ref> In 1984, he left ILM to direct a commercial for the [[American Cancer Society]] that shows a fetus smoking a cigarette.<ref name="playboy2014"/> This quickly brought Fincher to the attention of producers in Los Angeles, and he was given the chance to direct the documentary ''The Beat of the Live Drum'', featuring [[Rick Springfield]], in 1985. Though he would continue to direct spots for companies like [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]], [[Converse (company)|Converse]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Pepsi-Cola|Pepsi]],  [[Revlon]], [[Sony]], [[Coca-Cola]], and [[Chanel]]<ref name="playboy2014"/> Fincher soon discovered music videos and went on to direct many promos. He directed the video for the 1986 release of the single [[We Don't Have To Take Our Clothes Off]], which was the biggest commercial success for Pop/R&B singer [[Jermaine Stewart]],<ref>http://www.biography.com/people/david-fincher-411094</ref> and extensively worked with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] directing several of her music videos including [[Express Yourself (Madonna song)|Express Yourself]], [[Oh Father]], [[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]] and  [[Bad Girl (Madonna song)|Bad Girl]]

===Propaganda Films===
Set on a directing career, Fincher joined video-production company [[Propaganda Films]] and started off directing music videos and commercials. Like Fincher, directors such as [[Michael Bay]], [[Antoine Fuqua]], [[Michel Gondry]], [[Spike Jonze]], [[Alex Proyas]], [[Paul Rachman]], [[Mark Romanek]], [[Zack Snyder]], [[Gore Verbinski]] and others honed their talents at Propaganda Films before moving on to feature films.

===Influences===
In an interview with ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine in 2008, Fincher named the following films as his favorites: ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979), ''[[All That Jazz (film)|All That Jazz]]'' (1979), ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'' (1976), ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (1973), ''[[Being There]]'' (1979), ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (1969), ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'' (1972), ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'' (1974), ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941), ''[[Days of Heaven]]'' (1978), ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964), ''[[8½]]'' (1963), ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' (1973), ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1974), ''[[The Graduate]]'' (1967), ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975), ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962), ''[[Mad Max 2]]'' (1981), ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (1975), ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'' (1978), ''[[Paper Moon (film)|Paper Moon]]'' (1973), ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976), ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984), ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously (film)|The Year of Living Dangerously]]'' (1982), and ''[[Zelig]]'' (1983).<ref>{{cite web |author= Fincher, David |url=http://www.theyshootpictures.com/fincherdavid.htm |title=They Shoot Pictures, Don't They?}}</ref>

===Feature films and television===
After directing several music videos, Fincher's feature debut was ''[[Alien 3]]'' (1992). While it received an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination for [[visual effects]], the film was not well received by critics or moviegoers. Fincher became involved with several disputes with [[20th Century Fox]] over script and budget issues. In ''Director's Cut: Picturing Hollywood in the 21st Century'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/082641902X |title=Director's Cut: Picturing Hollywood in the 21st Century |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=September 14, 2010}}</ref> he blames the producers for not putting the necessary trust in him. He stated in an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2009: "No one hated it more than me; to this day, no one hates it more than me." After this, he retreated back into the world of commercial and music video directing, including the video for the [[Grammy Award]]-winning track "[[Love Is Strong]]" (1994) by [[The Rolling Stones]].

In 1995, Fincher directed ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]''. The film, based on a screenplay by [[Andrew Kevin Walker]], told the story of two detectives (played by [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Morgan Freeman]]) tracking down a serial killer who bases his killings on the [[seven deadly sins]]. The film grossed more than $100&nbsp;million domestically (over $300&nbsp;million internationally).<ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=seven.htm |title=''Seven'' |date=1995|website= [[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=2010-09-14}}</ref>

After the success of ''Seven'', Fincher went on to film ''[[The Game (1997 film)|The Game]]'' (1997). The story focused on a closed-off San Francisco businessman (played by [[Michael Douglas]]) who receives an unusual gift from his younger brother ([[Sean Penn]]), in which he becomes the main player of a [[role-playing game]] that takes over his life. The film had middling box-office returns despite being well received by critics.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

''[[Fight Club]]'' (1999) is a screen adaptation of [[Chuck Palahniuk]]'s 1996 [[Fight Club (novel)|novel]] about an insomniac office worker who opens up a club devoted exclusively to bare knuckle fighting for men. Featuring [[Edward Norton]], [[Helena Bonham Carter]], and ''Seven'' collaborator Brad Pitt, the film was an early disappointment at the box-office and received mixed reviews.  ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', which had originally given the film a D-,<ref>Entertainment Weekly – [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,64292,00.html Review of Fight Club (1999)].

January 19, 2001</ref>

In 2006, the British magazine ''[[Total Film]]'' voted ''Fight Club'' number four in the 100 Greatest Movies of All Time, beaten only by ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' and ''[[Goodfellas]]'' at 3, 2 and 1 respectively.<ref>{{cite web|author=Total Film |url=http://www.totalfilm.com/movie_news/who_is_the_greatest |title=Who is the greatest? |publisher=Total Film |date= |accessdate=September 23, 2010}}</ref>

In 2002, Fincher followed up with the thriller ''[[Panic Room]]''. The film earned over $92&nbsp;million at the U.S. box office. The story follows a single mother ([[Jodie Foster]]) and her daughter ([[Kristen Stewart]]) as they hide in a safe room of their new house, away from criminals ([[Forest Whitaker]], [[Dwight Yoakam]], and ''Fight Club'' collaborator [[Jared Leto]]) bent on finding a missing fortune. Fincher acknowledged ''Panic Room'' as a more mainstream thriller, describing the film, on the DVD's audio commentary, as "[basically] a date movie" and a "really good [[B movie]]" about "two people trapped in a closet".

Five years after ''Panic Room'', Fincher returned on March 2, 2007 with ''[[Zodiac (film)|Zodiac]]'', an adaptation of [[Robert Graysmith]]'s books about the hunt for the [[Zodiac Killer]] that starred [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], [[Mark Ruffalo]], [[Robert Downey, Jr.]], [[Anthony Edwards]], and [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]. The first of Fincher's films to be [[digital cinematography|shot digitally]], the majority of the film was recorded on a [[Digital cinematography cameras|Thompson Viper Film Stream Camera]]. However, high-speed film cameras were used for the Blue Rock Springs and Presidio Heights murder scenes for the slow-motion shots.<ref>Zodiac Director's Cut DVD, 2nd Disc, Visual Effects featurette.</ref> It was originally to be released in the fall of 2006 but was pushed back after Fincher refused to cut 20 minutes off the film.

''Zodiac'' was one of the best-reviewed films of that year, with only two other 2007 films appearing on more top-10 lists (''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'' and ''[[There Will Be Blood]]'').<ref>[http://www.criticstop10.com/ Best of 2007 « CriticsTop10]. Criticstop10.com. Retrieved on 2014-02-01.</ref> However, the film struggled at the box office in the U.S., earning only $33&nbsp;million, but did well overseas with a foreign gross of $51.7&nbsp;million. Worldwide, ''Zodiac'' was a decent success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficereport.com/ybon/2007gross.shtml |title=2007 Box Office |publisher=Box Office Report |date=January 6, 2009 |accessdate=September 23, 2010}}</ref> Despite an aggressive campaign by the studio, expectations surrounding Robert Downey, Jr.'s supporting performance, Fincher's direction and Vanderbilt's adapted script, the film did not earn a single [[Academy Award]] nomination.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080420142900/http://www.oscars.org/80academyawards/nominees/index.html Nominees]. 80th Annual Academy Awards.

A story about life and death, ''[[The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (film)|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button]]'' is an adaptation of [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s [[The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (short story)|short story of the same name]]. The film was Fincher's third with Brad Pitt. The film started shooting in November 2006 in New Orleans, before moving on to the Virgin Islands, Montreal, and L.A. Both ''Zodiac'' and this film are co-productions of [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Warner Bros.]] The budget for the film was estimated at $150&nbsp;million, partly due to the CGI effects used to reverse the aging in Pitt's character. The film is the first PG-13 film directed by Fincher. It received 13 nominations at the [[81st Academy Awards]], including Fincher's first nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. It won three [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction]], [[Academy Award for Best Makeup|Best Makeup]], and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]].

Fincher directed the 2010 film ''[[The Social Network]]'', about the legal battles of [[Mark Zuckerberg]] and the founding of [[Facebook]]. The film features an Oscar-winning screenplay by [[Aaron Sorkin]], adapted from the book ''[[The Accidental Billionaires]]''. Featuring a young cast ensemble, the film was produced by [[Scott Rudin]], [[Kevin Spacey]] and [[Michael DeLuca]]. Filming started in October 2009<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2009/09/22/confirmed-eisenberg-timberlake-and-garfield-cast-in-david-finchers-the-social-network |title=Confirmed: Eisenberg, Timberlake and Garfield Cast in David Fincher's The Social Network |publisher="Slashfilm.com |date=September 22, 2009 |accessdate=September 23, 2010}}</ref> and was released a year later, to critical acclaim. [[Trent Reznor]] and [[Atticus Ross]] created the Oscar-winning soundtrack for the film. Fincher had long been a fan of Reznor's work in [[Nine Inch Nails]], even putting a remix of "[[Closer (Nine Inch Nails song)|Closer]]" in the beginning of ''Seven'' and directing the music video for "[[Only (Nine Inch Nails song)|Only]]". The film went on to win many awards, including four Golden Globes (including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama|Best Motion Picture – Drama]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]), three BAFTAs (including Best Direction), and three [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay)|Best Adapted Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/jan/17/golden-globes-ricky-gervais-colin-firth-social-network|title=Golden Globes: Colin Firth crowned while The Social Network wins lion's share|date=January 17, 2011|work=Guardian|accessdate=January 20, 2011|location=London|first=Xan|last=Brooks}}</ref>

Fincher directed the American version of ''[[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011 film)|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]'', which was based on the [[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo|book]] by [[Stieg Larsson]], with a script written by [[Steven Zaillian]]. The film was shot in Sweden, with [[Rooney Mara]] (who played Erica Albright in ''The Social Network'')  as Lisbeth Salander, [[Daniel Craig]] as Mikael Blomkvist, [[Robin Wright (actress)|Robin Wright]] as Erika Berger, [[Stellan Skarsgård]] as Martin Vanger and [[Christopher Plummer]] as Henrik Vanger. The film was released on December 21, 2011. ''Dragon Tattoo'' writer Steve Zaillian is in the early stage of scripting ''[[The Girl Who Played with Fire]]'', which Fincher has the option to direct. While he has not yet committed to the project, the Oscar-nominated filmmaker has admitted that (should he sign on) he would prefer to shoot both the second and third Millennium book adaptations back-to-back, for both practical and artistic purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/01/02/dragon-tattoo-sequel-girl-who-played-with-fire/|title='Dragon Tattoo' sequel still on track, Sony says |date=January 3, 2012|work=EW.com|accessdate=January 3, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/girl-played-fire-dragon-tattoo-sequel-sandy-145697/|title=‘Girl with the Dragon Tattoo’ Sequel is Still Moving Forward |date=January 3, 2012|work=ScreenRant.com|accessdate=January 3, 2012}}</ref> Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross composed the soundtrack for the film (their second collaboration with Fincher).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/trent-reznor-scoring-david-finchers-version-the-girl-dragon-tattoo/|title=Trent Reznor Scoring David Fincher's Version of "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" |date=January 7, 2011|work=Slashfilm|accessdate=March 24, 2011}}</ref> It received five [[Academy Award]] nominations at the [[84th Academy Awards]] including: [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Rooney Mara, [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing]], [[Best Sound Mixing]] and won one award for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]].
