Ephron's marriage with Bernstein ended acrimoniously, and after the breakup Ephron was open about the identity of Deep Throat.<ref name="timesneck"/> She revealed his identity to her son Jacob and anyone else who asked.

And I would say, 'It's [[Mark Felt]].'"<ref name="timesneck"/> Classmates of Jacob Bernstein at the [[Dalton School]] and [[Vassar College]] recall Jacob's revealing to numerous people that Felt was Deep Throat.

* "Like most of my contemporaries, I first read ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' when I was 18 years old. I loved it. I too missed the point. I thought it was a book about a strong-willed architect...and his love life.... I deliberately skipped over all the passages about egoism and altruism. And I spent the next year hoping I would meet a gaunt, orange-haired architect who would rape me. Or failing that, an architect who would rape me. Or failing that, an architect. I am certain that ''The Fountainhead'' did a great deal more for architects than Architectural Forum ever dreamed." ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' (1968)
