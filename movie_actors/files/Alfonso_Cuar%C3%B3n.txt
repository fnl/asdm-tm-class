''[[Y Tu Mamá También]]'' (2001), the fantasy film ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' (2004), and science fiction thrillers ''[[Children of Men]]'' (2006) and ''[[Gravity (film)|Gravity]]'' (2013). Cuarón is the first Mexican director to win an [[Academy Award for Best Directing]].<ref>http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/03/alfonso-cuaron-wins-best-director-oscar</ref>

Most of his work has been praised by both audiences and critics, and has been nominated for six [[Academy Award]]s including [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] for ''Y Tu Mamá También'', and both [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] for ''Children of Men''. For ''Gravity'', Cuarón received several major accolades for his achievement in direction, winning in the respective categories at the Academy Awards, the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Golden Globe Awards]], the [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction|BAFTA Awards]] and the [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Feature Film|Directors Guild of America]]; and in addition winning the BAFTA Award [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best British Film]] and the Academy Award for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] (shared with [[Mark Sanger]]). He has also been awarded the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|BAFTA Award for Best Film not in the English Language]] as one of the producers of ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'' (2006). In his films, Cuarón is known for his ground-breaking use in the technique of [[long take|continuous uninterrupted shots]].

Cuarón's brother [[Carlos Cuarón|Carlos]], as well as his son [[Jonás Cuarón|Jonás]], are also writers and directors and have both acted as co-writers in some of his works. He is also friends with fellow Mexican directors [[Guillermo del Toro]] and [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]], collectively known as "The Three Amigos of Cinema."{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Early life==
Alfonso Cuarón was born in [[Mexico City]], and is the son of Alfredo Cuarón, a nuclear physicist who worked for the United Nations' [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] for many years. He has two brothers, [[Carlos Cuarón|Carlos]], also a filmmaker, and Alfredo, a conservation biologist.

Cuarón studied Philosophy at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM) and filmmaking at CUEC ([[Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematográficos]]), a school within the same University. There, he met director Carlos Marcovich and [[cinematographer]] [[Emmanuel Lubezki]], and they made what would be his first [[short film]], ''Vengeance Is Mine''.

==Career==

Cuarón began working in television in Mexico, first as a technician and then as a director. His television work led to assignments as an assistant director for several Latin American film productions including ''[[Gaby: A True Story]]'' and ''[[Romero (film)|Romero]]'', and in 1991, he landed his first big-screen directorial assignment. On January 12, 2014, Alfonso accepted the [[Golden Globe Award]] in the category [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for [[Gravity (film)|Gravity]] ([[71st Golden Globe Awards|The 71st Annual Golden Globe Awards]], 2014). He also won two Oscars for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Directing|Best Directing]].

===''Sólo con tu pareja''===
''[[Sólo con tu pareja]]'' was a sex comedy about a womanizing businessman (played by [[Daniel Giménez Cacho]]) who, after spurning an attractive nurse, is fooled into believing he's contracted [[AIDS]]. In addition to writing, producing and directing, Cuarón co-edited the film with Luis Patlán. It is somewhat unusual for directors to be credited co-editors, although the [[Coen Brothers]] and [[Robert Rodriguez]] have both directed and edited nearly all of their films. Cuarón continued this close involvement in editing on several of his later films.

The film, which also starred cabaret singer [[Astrid Hadad]] and model/actress Claudia Ramírez (with whom Cuarón was linked between 1989 and 1993), was a big hit in Mexico. After this success, director [[Sydney Pollack]] hired Cuarón to direct an episode of ''[[Fallen Angels (TV series)|Fallen Angels]]'', a series of [[neo-noir]] stories produced for the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] premium cable network in 1993; other directors who worked on the series included [[Steven Soderbergh]], [[Jonathan Kaplan]], [[Peter Bogdanovich]] and [[Tom Hanks]].

===International success===
[[Image:AlfonsoCuaron 20050923.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cuarón in 2005]]

In 1995, Cuarón released his first feature film produced in the United States, ''[[A Little Princess (1995 film)|A Little Princess]]'', an adaptation of [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]]'s classic novel. Cuarón's next feature was also a literary adaptation, a modernized version of [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[Great Expectations (1998 film)|Great Expectations]]'' starring [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] and [[Robert De Niro]].

Cuarón's next project found him returning to Mexico with a Spanish-speaking cast to film ''[[Y Tu Mamá También]]'', starring [[Gael García Bernal]], [[Diego Luna]] and [[Maribel Verdú]]. It was a provocative and controversial road comedy about two sexually obsessed teenagers who take an extended road trip with an attractive married woman in her late twenties. The film's open portrayal of sexuality and frequent rude humor, as well as the politically and socially relevant asides, made the film an international hit and a major success with critics. Cuarón shared an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)|Best Original Screenplay]] with co-writer and brother [[Carlos Cuarón]].

In 2003, Cuarón directed the third film in the successful ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' series, ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]''. Cuarón faced criticism from some of the more purist ''[[Harry Potter]]'' fans for his approach to the film. At the time of the movie's release, however, author [[J. K. Rowling]], who had seen and loved Cuarón's film ''Y Tu Mamá También'', said that it was her personal favorite from the series so far.<ref>[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=76 J.K. Rowling] Accessed January 17, 2007.</ref> Critically, the film was also better received than the first two installments, with some critics remarking that it was the first ''Harry Potter'' film to truly capture the essence of the novels.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban/ RT: Prisoner of Azkaban]</ref> It remained as the most critically acclaimed film of the ''Harry Potter'' film franchise until the release of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2]]''.

Cuarón's feature ''[[Children of Men]]'', an adaptation of the [[P. D. James]] novel starring [[Clive Owen]], [[Julianne Moore]] and [[Michael Caine]], received wide critical acclaim, including three [[Academy Award]] nominations. Cuarón himself received two nominations for his work on the film in [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] (with [[Alex Rodríguez (film editor)|Alex Rodríguez]]) and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] (with several collaborators).

He created the production and distribution company [[Esperanto Filmoj]] (''Esperanto Films'', named because of his support for the international language [[Esperanto]]<ref>[http://esperantodocumentary.com/blog/an-interview-with-director-alfonso-cuaron Interview] by [[Sam Green]] with Cuarón.</ref>), which has credits in the films ''[[Duck Season]]'', ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'', and ''[[Gravity (film)|Gravity]]''.

Cuarón also directed the controversial public service announcement "I Am Autism" for [[Autism Speaks]] that was sharply criticized by disability rights groups for its negative portrayal of autism.<ref>[http://asansouthwestohio.blogspot.com/2009/09/autistic-community-condemns-autism.html Autistic Community Condemns Autism Speaks]</ref>

In 2010, Cuarón began to develop the film ''[[Gravity (film)|Gravity]]'', a drama set in space. He was joined by producer [[David Heyman]], with whom Cuarón worked on ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]''. Starring [[Sandra Bullock]] and [[George Clooney]], the film was released in the fall of 2013<ref>[http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/05/14/sandra-bullock-gravity-2013 Sandra Bullock, George Clooney sci-fi drama 'Gravity' pushed to 2013]</ref> and opened the [[70th Venice International Film Festival]] in August.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2404711/Venice-Film-Festival-2013-Sandra-Bullock-stuns-scarlet-dress-George-Clooney.html Venice Film Festival 2013: Sandra Bullock stuns in a scarlet dress with George Clooney | Mail Online]. Dailymail.co.uk. Retrieved on 2014-05-22.</ref> The film received ten [[Academy Award]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Directing|Best Directing]]. Cuarón won for Best Directing, becoming the first Latin American to win the award, while he and [[Mark Sanger]] shared the award for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]].

In 2013, Cuarón created ''[[Believe (TV series)|Believe]]'', a science fiction/fantasy/adventure series that is being broadcast as part of the 2013–14 United States network television schedule on NBC as a mid-season entry. The series was created by Cuarón for Bad Robot Productions and Warner Bros. Television. In 2014, ''[[TIME]]'' placed him in its list of "[[100 Most Influential People in the World]]" - Pioneers.<ref>{{cite news | title =The 100 Most Influential People - Pioneers: Alfonso Cuarón |publisher= TIME.com| url = http://time.com/70897/alfonso-cuaron-2014-time-100/|date=April 23, 2014| accessdate = 2014-04-26  }}</ref>

In May 2015 Cuarón was announced as the President of the Jury for the [[72nd Venice International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/news/11-05.html |title=Director Alfonso Cuarón President of the International Jury for the Venezia 72 Competition |date=11 May 2015 |accessdate=11 May 2015 |work=Venice Biennale}}</ref>
