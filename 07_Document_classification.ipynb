    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In text mining, the classifier often matters much less than *everything else* (tokenization, n-grams, feature selection strategies, etc.), at least if you choose a fairly decent, but still rather simple classifier (here: multinoulli Naive Bayes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another set of red flags are the test times of the Random Forset (think: gradient boosting, etc.) and kNN classifiers, i.e., their prohibitively large *prediction times* - at least if you are planning to deploy your classifier in settings where the time it takes to present results (to the user) matters, and the enormous training time of the Random Forest classifier (hint: a deep learning network would be even worse...)."
